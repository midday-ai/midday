## Vision & Mission

### Vision

A world where every MCA operator — from a one-person shop to a $100M fund — has the tools to run their business with clarity, confidence, and control.

### Mission

Abacus removes the operational chaos from running an MCA business. We turn scattered spreadsheets into a unified command center, surface the insights that matter, and automate the work that doesn't require human judgment.

### The One-Liner

> "Your spreadsheet, supercharged."

### The Elevator Pitch

> Abacus is the operating system for Merchant Cash Advance businesses. We start simple — connect your Google Sheet, and our AI instantly understands your data. You're live in 5 minutes with a professional dashboard, risk alerts, and a **branded merchant portal where your borrowers can log in, see their balance, and make payments.** That portal alone would cost you $50K to build. With Abacus, it's included.
>
> But we're building much more. As you grow, Abacus grows with you — payment processing, bank integrations, underwriting, collections automation. Eventually, your entire lending operation runs on Abacus. We're the Shopify of alternative lending: start simple, scale to everything.

### The Vision Statement

> **Today:** Turn spreadsheets into professional dashboards (the wedge)
> **Tomorrow:** Process payments and connect to banks (stickiness)  
> **Future:** Underwrite deals, manage origination, automate collections (full stack)
>
> We're not building portfolio software. We're building the **infrastructure layer** for alternative lending.

## The Problem

### The Current State of MCA Operations

Running an MCA business today means:

**Spreadsheet Hell**
- Portfolio data lives in Google Sheets or Excel
- Multiple tabs, inconsistent formatting, version confusion
- No real-time visibility — you only know what you manually check
- Formulas break, data gets stale, mistakes compound

**Fragmented Tools**
- Bank account for transaction data
- Email for merchant communication
- Separate system for collections
- PDFs scattered across folders
- No single source of truth

**Operational Blindness**
- "Which merchants are at risk?" requires manual analysis
- "What came in today?" requires logging into bank accounts
- "Who needs a collection call?" requires checking multiple sources
- By the time you spot a problem, it's often too late

**Painful Scaling**
- Every new deal means more spreadsheet rows to manage
- Hiring staff means training them on your specific spreadsheet setup
- Growth creates chaos instead of leverage

**Enterprise Software Isn't Built for You**
- LoanPro and similar platforms cost $5K+/month
- Require months of implementation
- Built for mid-market and enterprise, not small operators
- Overkill for a 5-person MCA shop

### The Pain in Numbers

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Hours per week on manual data entry | 5-10 hours |
| Missed collection opportunities | 10-15% of at-risk accounts |
| Time to onboard new team member | 2-4 weeks |
| Deals lost due to slow processing | Unknown, but real |
| Sleep lost worrying about portfolio | Priceless |

## The Solution

### Abacus: Your MCA Command Center

Abacus is the operating system for your MCA business. It connects to your existing data (starting with Google Sheets), applies intelligence, and gives you real-time visibility and control.

**Not a replacement for your spreadsheet — an upgrade.**

We meet you where you are. You don't have to migrate data, learn a new system, or change how you work. Abacus reads your spreadsheet, understands it, and builds a professional interface on top of it.

### How It Works

### The Abacus Difference

| Traditional Software | Abacus |
|---------------------|--------|
| 3-month implementation | Live in 5 minutes |
| $5,000+/month | $500/month |
| Requires data migration | Works with your spreadsheet |
| Training required | AI figures out your data |
| You check dashboards | We push what matters to you |
| Generic financial software | Built specifically for MCA |

### The Hidden Superpower: Instant Professionalization

Here's what most people miss: **Abacus makes small operators look like big players.**

When you sign up for Abacus, you don't just get a dashboard for yourself. You get:

**A Branded Merchant Portal**
Your merchants can log in to `yourcompany.abacus.app` and see:
- Their current balance
- Payment history
- Request payoff letters
- Make payments directly
- Download statements

This is something that would cost a small MCA **$30,000-$50,000+ to build** — custom development, hosting, security, maintenance. With Abacus, it's included. Turn it on, add your logo, and suddenly you look like a $100M operation.

**Why This Matters:**
- Merchants trust you more (you look professional)
- Fewer inbound calls ("what's my balance?")
- Faster payments (they can pay through the portal)
- Competitive advantage vs. MCAs still using email and phone

**The Professionalization Stack:**
```
WITHOUT ABACUS                    WITH ABACUS
─────────────────                 ─────────────────
"Call us for balance"      →      Branded merchant login
Email PDFs manually        →      Auto-generated statements
"Check's in the mail"      →      Pay online instantly
Spreadsheet chaos          →      Professional dashboard
Amateur hour               →      Enterprise-grade operation
```

This is how a 3-person MCA shop competes with institutional players.

## Product Strategy: The Path to Full-Stack

### The Wedge → Platform → Full-Stack Journey

### Why This Sequence Matters

**Phase 1 (Spreadsheets)** gets us in with zero friction. No one says no to "just connect your spreadsheet."

**Phase 2 (Merchant Portal)** creates massive switching costs. Once merchants are logging into your Abacus-powered portal, you can't leave without breaking their experience.

**Phase 3 (Payments)** puts us in the middle of money flow. When payments come through Abacus, we have the data, the float, and the stickiness.

**Phase 4 (Underwriting)** moves us upstream. Now we're not just servicing deals, we're helping make them. This is where the big money is.

**Phase 5 (Full Stack)** makes us the operating system. You can't run your MCA without Abacus. We ARE the infrastructure.

### The Full-Stack Vision

Eventually, Abacus covers the entire MCA lifecycle:

### Primary: Small-to-Midsize MCA Operators

**Company Profile:**
- Annual funding volume: $5M - $50M
- Team size: 1-10 people
- Portfolio size: 50-500 active merchants
- Current tools: Google Sheets, basic accounting software
- Pain level: High (drowning in spreadsheets)
- Budget: $500-$2,000/month for software

**Operator Profile:**
- Financially sophisticated, not technically sophisticated
- Knows MCA deeply, doesn't want to learn complex software
- Values time over features
- Needs visibility more than automation
- Often owner-operated or small partnership

### Secondary: Growing MCA Operations

**Company Profile:**
- Annual funding volume: $50M - $200M
- Team size: 10-30 people
- Portfolio size: 500-2,000 active merchants
- Current tools: Mix of spreadsheets and basic software
- Pain level: Critical (growth is breaking their systems)
- Budget: $2,000-$5,000/month for software

### Why We Win These Segments

1. **Underserved by incumbents** — LoanPro focuses on larger operations
2. **Spreadsheet-first approach** — No scary migration required
3. **MCA-specific** — We speak their language
4. **Affordable** — 10x cheaper than enterprise alternatives
5. **Fast time-to-value** — See results in minutes, not months

### Who We Don't Serve (Yet)

- MCAs below $1M annual volume (too small)
- MCAs above $200M annual volume (need enterprise features)
- Non-MCA lenders (different workflows)
- Banks and credit unions (different regulations)

## Core Philosophy

### Inspired by Midday

> "Instead of pulling information out of the system, [Abacus] pushes the right information to you."

We don't build software that you have to constantly check. We build software that tells you what's changed, what needs attention, and what's on track — so you can focus on running your business.

### The Three Pillars

#### 1. Push, Don't Pull

**Traditional Software:** You log in, navigate, search, filter, analyze.
**Abacus:** We tell you "3 merchants went late this week" before you even ask.

- Weekly portfolio summaries delivered to your inbox
- Real-time alerts for NSFs, late payments, risk changes
- Proactive notifications, not passive dashboards

#### 2. Meet Them Where They Are

**Traditional Software:** "Migrate your data to our system."
**Abacus:** "Paste your Google Sheet link. We'll figure out the rest."

- Start with spreadsheets (everyone has them)
- AI understands your column names and data patterns
- No implementation, no training, no behavior change required
- Graduate to more sophisticated features over time

#### 3. Clarity Over Complexity

**Traditional Software:** 47 features, 12 modules, 200-page manual.
**Abacus:** "Here are the 5 merchants you should call today."

- Show what matters, hide what doesn't
- Default to simplicity, unlock complexity when needed
- Every feature earns its place by solving a real problem

## Product Principles

### 1. Five-Minute Time to Value

A new user should be able to:
1. Sign up
2. Connect their spreadsheet
3. See their portfolio dashboard

...in under 5 minutes, with zero help from us.

### 2. AI-Native, Not AI-Added

AI isn't a feature we bolt on — it's foundational:
- AI understands your spreadsheet structure
- AI categorizes and interprets your data
- AI surfaces risks and opportunities
- AI generates letters and communications

### 3. Spreadsheet as Onramp

We don't fight the spreadsheet — we embrace it:
- Import from Google Sheets
- Keep spreadsheet as source of truth (initially)
- Optionally graduate to Abacus as source of truth
- Always allow export back to spreadsheet

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Don't overwhelm new users with every feature:
- Start simple: portfolio view, basic metrics
- Unlock features as they become relevant
- Power users can access everything
- New users see only what they need

### 5. Opinionated Defaults, Flexible Overrides

We make smart choices so you don't have to:
- Default risk thresholds that work for most MCAs
- Standard letter templates ready to use
- Collection workflows based on best practices

But everything is configurable for those who want control.

### 6. Mobile-Aware, Desktop-First

MCA operators work at their desks, but check status on the go:
- Full functionality on desktop
- Key information accessible on mobile
- Notifications work everywhere

---

## Feature Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

#### Portfolio Dashboard
The command center. One screen to see everything that matters.

- **Key Metrics:** Active MCAs, Total Outstanding, Total Repaid, At Risk Count
- **Smart Lists:** Upcoming Renewals, Almost Finished, Delinquency Watch
- **Merchant Table:** Full portfolio with search, filter, sort
- **Trend Indicators:** +/- vs last week, month

#### AI-Powered Onboarding
Connect your spreadsheet and go.

- Paste Google Sheets link
- AI analyzes columns and sample data
- AI suggests column mappings with confidence scores
- User confirms or corrects
- Dashboard generates automatically

#### AI Spreadsheet Logic Analysis (Killer Feature)
Automatically understand your existing spreadsheet mechanics — no manual rewiring required.

**The Problem:** Every MCA operator has their own spreadsheet with custom formulas, fee structures, and business logic. Manually mapping this to Abacus can take 40+ hours per customer.

**The Solution:** Our AI analyzes your spreadsheet to understand:
- Factor rate calculations and structures
- Principal and funded amount logic
- Fee structures and payment schedules
- Balance calculations and formulas
- Status codes and their meanings
- Custom fields and business-specific logic

**How It Works:**
1. Connect your Google Sheet
2. AI scans formulas, cell relationships, and data patterns
3. AI infers your business mechanics (not just column names)
4. Auto-populate mappings based on detected logic
5. Review and override any mappings in the UI
6. Go live with accurate, logic-aware data

**Technology:** Leverages Claude AI (via API and Claude for Sheets) to perform intelligent spreadsheet analysis.

**Impact:** Reduces onboarding from 40+ hours of manual mapping to minutes of AI-assisted setup with human review.

## The Merchant Portal: Your Secret Weapon

The merchant portal deserves its own section because it's a **massive differentiator**.

### What Small MCAs Have Today

```
Merchant: "Hey, what's my balance?"

MCA Operator: *Opens spreadsheet*
              *Searches for merchant*
              *Calculates remaining balance*
              *Types email or makes phone call*

Time: 5-10 minutes
Happens: 10-20 times per day
Annual cost: $15,000+ in lost productivity
```

### What Abacus Gives Them

```
Merchant: *Logs into portal*
          *Sees balance instantly*
          *Downloads statement*

**For the MCA Operator:**
- White-labeled with your logo and colors
- Custom domain option (portal.yourcompany.com)
- Control what merchants can see
- Enable/disable payments
- Automatic balance updates from your data
- See portal activity in your dashboard

### Why This Creates Massive Lock-In

Once your merchants are using the portal:

1. **They expect it.** Try taking it away — they'll complain.
2. **They've bookmarked it.** It's part of their routine.
3. **They might have auto-pay set up.** Breaking that is painful.
4. **You've sent them there.** "Check your balance at..."

Switching to a competitor means:
- Breaking merchant experience
- Resending new login credentials
- Potential payment disruption
- Looking unprofessional ("sorry, we changed systems")

**The portal isn't just a feature. It's a moat.**

**Key Principle:** Single codebase, single database, data isolated by `org_id` with Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase.

### Configuration-Driven Design

Instead of custom code per customer, we use configuration:

```typescript
interface OrganizationConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  
  // Data source
  dataSource: {
    type: 'google_sheets' | 'database';
    sheetId?: string;
    syncFrequency: 'realtime' | '5min' | '15min' | 'hourly';
  };
  
  // Column mappings (from AI onboarding)
  columnMappings: {
    merchant_name: string;
    funded_amount: string;
    factor_rate: string;
    total_payback: string;
    remaining_balance: string;
    status: string;
    funding_date: string;
    // Optional fields
    broker_name?: string;
    rep_name?: string;
    phone?: string;
    email?: string;
    notes?: string;
  };
  
  // Status code interpretations
  statusCodes: {
    active: string[];      // e.g., ["A", "Active", "ACTIVE"]
    paid_off: string[];    // e.g., ["P", "Paid", "PAID OFF"]
    default: string[];     // e.g., ["D", "Default", "DEF"]
    collections: string[]; // e.g., ["C", "Coll", "COLLECTIONS"]
  };
  
  // Enabled features
  features: {
    brokers: boolean;
    reps: boolean;
    commissions: boolean;
    collectionsWorkflow: boolean;
    letterGeneration: boolean;
    merchantPortal: boolean;
    aiAssistant: boolean;
  };
  
  // Branding
  branding: {
    companyName: string;
    logoUrl?: string;
    primaryColor: string;
    signatoryName?: string;
    signatoryTitle?: string;
  };
  
  // Rules (for automation)
  rules: Rule[];
  
  // Letter templates
  letterTemplates: LetterTemplate[];
}
```

## AI & Intelligence

### AI-Powered Onboarding

The key differentiator. When a user connects their spreadsheet:

```
1. INGEST
   - Connect to Google Sheets API
   - Pull headers and first 50 rows
   - Detect data types (currency, dates, percentages, codes)

2. INTERPRET (Claude API)
   - Send headers + sample data to LLM
   - Prompt: "This is an MCA portfolio spreadsheet. 
             Identify what each column represents."
   - Return: Mappings with confidence scores
   
3. CONFIRM
   - Show user the interpreted mappings
   - Highlight low-confidence items
   - Allow corrections
   
4. ACTIVATE
   - Save configuration
   - Sync all data
   - Generate dashboard
```

**Sample AI Prompt:**

```markdown
You are analyzing a Google Sheet used by a Merchant Cash Advance company.

Headers: ["Merchant", "DBA", "Funded", "Factor", "Payback", "Daily", "Bal", "Status", "Fund Dt"]

Sample rows:
[
  ["Joe's Pizza", "Joe's NYC Pizza", "$25,000", "1.35", "$33,750", "$285", "$18,200", "A", "10/15/24"],
  ["ABC Trucking", "ABC Transport LLC", "$50,000", "1.40", "$70,000", "$575", "$0", "P", "6/1/24"],
  ...
]

For each column, identify:
1. What MCA concept it represents
2. The data type
3. For status codes, what each value means
4. Confidence level (0-100%)

Respond in JSON format.
```

### AI Spreadsheet Logic Analysis

Beyond column mapping, Abacus uses AI to understand the *business logic* embedded in your spreadsheet.

**What We Analyze:**
```typescript
interface SpreadsheetLogicAnalysis {
  // Formula detection
  formulas: {
    cell: string;
    formula: string;
    purpose: 'balance_calc' | 'payment_calc' | 'fee_calc' | 'status_logic' | 'other';
    dependencies: string[];
  }[];

  // Inferred business mechanics
  mechanics: {
    factorRateStructure: 'flat' | 'tiered' | 'variable';
    feeStructure: 'upfront' | 'backend' | 'split' | 'none';
    paymentFrequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'variable';
    balanceCalculation: 'simple' | 'amortizing' | 'custom';
  };

  // Data relationships
  relationships: {
    sourceColumn: string;
    targetColumn: string;
    relationship: 'sum' | 'product' | 'difference' | 'lookup' | 'custom';
  }[];

  // Confidence scores
  confidence: {
    overall: number;
    perMechanic: Record<string, number>;
  };
}
```

**Sample AI Prompt for Logic Analysis:**

```markdown
You are analyzing a Google Sheet used by an MCA company. Beyond identifying columns, understand the BUSINESS LOGIC:

1. Examine formulas to understand how balances are calculated
2. Identify fee structures (upfront fees, backend fees, etc.)
3. Detect payment calculation logic
4. Map relationships between columns (e.g., Payback = Principal × Factor Rate)
5. Identify any custom business rules embedded in formulas

For each detected mechanic, provide:
- What it calculates
- The formula/logic used
- Confidence level (0-100%)
- Suggested Abacus field mapping

Return structured JSON with your analysis.
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Claude API** for complex logic analysis
- **Claude for Sheets** browser extension for in-context analysis
- **Google Sheets API** for formula extraction and cell relationship mapping

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
interface RiskFactors {
  // Payment consistency (0-100, higher = more consistent)
  paymentConsistency: number;
  
  // NSF frequency (count in last 30 days)
  recentNSFCount: number;
  
  // Days since last payment
  daysSinceLastPayment: number;
  
  // Balance trend (increasing = bad if not paying down)
  balanceTrend: 'decreasing' | 'stable' | 'increasing';
  
  // Percent paid
  percentPaid: number;
  
  // Days in deal
  daysInDeal: number;
}

function calculateRiskScore(factors: RiskFactors): number {
  let score = 100; // Start at 100 (no risk)
  
  // Deduct for payment inconsistency
  score -= (100 - factors.paymentConsistency) * 0.3;
  
  // Deduct for NSFs
  score -= factors.recentNSFCount * 15;
  
  // Deduct for days without payment
  if (factors.daysSinceLastPayment > 3) {
    score -= (factors.daysSinceLastPayment - 3) * 5;
  }
  
  // Deduct for increasing balance
  if (factors.balanceTrend === 'increasing') {
    score -= 20;
  }
  
  // Clamp to 0-100
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, score));
}

// Risk tiers
// 80-100: Low risk (green)
// 50-79: Medium risk (yellow)
// 0-49: High risk (red)
```

### AI Assistant Capabilities

```
USER: "Which merchants should I worry about?"

ABACUS: Based on payment patterns and risk scores, I'd watch these 4:

1. Joe's Pizza (HF1234)
   - 3 NSFs this month (was consistent before)
   - Risk score dropped from 85 to 42
   - Recommendation: Call today

2. ABC Trucking (HF1456)
   - Payment amount dropped 40% last week
   - No NSFs, but pattern change is concerning
   - Recommendation: Check in

3. Main St Cafe (HF1789)
   - No payment in 5 days (usually daily)
   - Risk score: 38
   - Recommendation: Immediate attention

4. Quick Mart (HF2345)
   - Balance increasing despite payments (fees accumulating?)
   - Recommendation: Review account

Want me to draft collection emails for any of these?

4. Guest on MCA industry podcasts
5. LinkedIn presence (Wilson can be an advocate)

**Target:** 100 customers, $75K MRR

### Phase 3: Sales-Assisted Growth (Months 24+)

**Strategy:** Add lightweight sales to accelerate growth.

**Tactics:**
1. Hire first sales rep (industry insider preferred)
2. Implement inbound demo request flow
3. Partner with MCA industry consultants
4. Explore broker partnerships (they work with multiple MCAs)

**Target:** 300+ customers, $250K+ MRR

### Channel Strategy

| Channel | Effort | Expected Yield |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Direct referrals | Low | High (warm leads) |
| Industry events | Medium | Medium (brand awareness) |
| Content marketing | Medium | Medium (long-term) |
| Broker partnerships | Medium | High (built-in distribution) |
| Paid advertising | Low (for now) | Low (niche market) |

### The Anti-Strategy

What we're NOT doing:
- Mass market advertising (too small a market)
- Aggressive outbound sales (not our style)
- Feature wars with LoanPro (different segment)
- Competing on price alone (race to bottom)

| Market too small | Low | High | Expand to adjacent verticals (factoring, equipment) |

### Product Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| AI onboarding doesn't work | Low | High | Extensive testing; fallback to manual mapping |

### Competitive Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| LoanPro launches SMB tier | Medium | High | Move fast; build relationships; switching costs |
| New entrant copies us | Medium | Medium | Speed; customer relationships; continuous innovation |
| Google Sheets adds features | Low | Medium | We add intelligence; spreadsheet is data layer, not app layer |

### Execution Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Can't hire fast enough | Medium | Medium | Start with contractors; productize heavily |
| Founder burnout | Medium | High | Set sustainable pace; take time off; find co-founder |
| Technical debt | Medium | Medium | Invest in architecture early; refactor regularly |

### Why Alternative Lending is Ripe for This

The alternative lending industry is where e-commerce was in 2010:
- Fragmented (thousands of small players)
- Underserved by technology
- Growing rapidly
- Ready for consolidation around modern infrastructure

**The winners will be platforms, not point solutions.**

LoanPro is trying to be Salesforce (enterprise, complex, expensive). We're building Shopify (start simple, grow with you, eventually run your whole business).

### Potential Exit Scenarios

| Scenario | When | Likely Acquirer | Estimated Value |
|----------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Early strategic | Year 2, $300K ARR | LoanPro, PE-backed lender | $3-5M |
| Growth acquisition | Year 3, $1.5M ARR | Fintech platform (Stripe, Plaid) | $15-30M |
| Market leader | Year 4, $5M ARR | Major fintech, large PE | $50-100M |
| Category winner | Year 5+, $10M+ ARR | Public company, large PE | $100M+ |

### The Dream Outcome

**Option A: Build a Generational Company**
Abacus becomes the infrastructure layer for alternative lending. Every MCA, factoring company, equipment lender, and revenue-based lender runs on Abacus. We IPO or stay private as a highly profitable platform business.

**Option B: Strategic Acquisition**
A major fintech (Stripe, Plaid, Toast) or lending platform (LoanPro, Blend) acquires us to add alternative lending to their stack. We become the "Shopify Capital" engine for their ecosystem.

**Option C: Roll-Up Play**
We use our platform position to acquire smaller point solutions (collections software, underwriting tools, broker CRMs) and become the consolidated leader in alternative lending technology.

**Any of these outcomes = success.** The key is building real value first.

### Testimonials

**Wilson Zoo** — Owner, Honest Funding LLC
> "Before Abacus, I was managing everything in spreadsheets and constantly worried I was missing something. Now I see my entire portfolio in one place — who's at risk, who's ready for renewal, what came in today. It's the visibility I always needed but never had."

**John DeSimonte** — Managing Partner, Emmy Capital
> "We went from chasing spreadsheets and digging through emails to having everything centralized and organized. Abacus cut our admin time in half and made collections way less stressful. I actually know where we stand now without having to ask anyone."
