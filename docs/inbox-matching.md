## Task Flow Architecture

### 1. New Transaction Processing

**Flow**: `upsert-transactions` → `embed-transaction` → `match-transactions-bidirectional`

```typescript
// Entry Point: Bank sync creates new transactions
upsertTransactions({
  transactions: [...],
  teamId,
  bankAccountId
})
  ↓
// Step 1: Create embeddings for new transactions
await embedTransaction.triggerAndWait({
  transactionIds,
  teamId
})
  ↓
// Step 2: Bidirectional matching in single efficient job
await tasks.trigger("match-transactions-bidirectional", {
  teamId,
  newTransactionIds: transactionIds
})
```

### 2. New Inbox Item Processing

**Flow**: `process-attachment` → `embed-inbox` → `batch-process-matching`

```typescript
// Entry Point: Gmail sync, email webhook, or manual upload
processAttachment({
  filePath,
  teamId,
  mimetype,
  size
})
  ↓
// Step 1: Process document (OCR, data extraction)
await updateInboxWithProcessedData(...)
  ↓
// Step 2: Create embeddings for inbox item
await embedInbox.triggerAndWait({
  inboxId,
  teamId
})
  ↓
// Step 3: Efficient batch matching
await tasks.trigger("batch-process-matching", {
  teamId,
  inboxIds: [inboxId]
})
```

## Matching Algorithm

### Multi-Tier Query Strategy

The algorithm uses a sophisticated multi-tier approach to find candidate matches efficiently:

#### Tier 1: Perfect Financial Matches
- **Criteria**: Exact amount + currency match OR base currency match
- **Date Range**: Document-type aware (invoices vs expenses)
- **Embedding Filter**: Weak threshold (< 0.6 distance) to ensure semantic relevance
- **Limit**: Top 5 candidates

#### Tier 2: Base Currency Matches (if needed)
- **Criteria**: Base currency amounts within 15% tolerance
- **Purpose**: Handle cross-currency transactions
- **Limit**: Additional 5 candidates

#### Tier 3: Strong Semantic Matches (if needed)
- **Criteria**: Strong embedding similarity (< 0.35 distance)
- **Purpose**: Find semantically similar transactions even with amount variations
- **Limit**: Additional candidates up to total of 8

#### Tier 4: Conservative Semantic Matches (if needed)
- **Criteria**: Moderate embedding similarity (< 0.45 distance)
- **Date Range**: Extended conservative ranges
- **Purpose**: Catch edge cases and delayed transactions

### Confidence Scoring

The matching confidence is calculated using weighted factors with team-specific calibration:

```typescript
const confidenceScore = 
  (embeddingScore * 0.45) +      // Semantic similarity (45%)
  (amountScore * 0.35) +         // Financial accuracy (35%)
  (currencyScore * 0.15) +       // Currency alignment (15%)
  (dateScore * 0.05)             // Temporal alignment (5%)
```

### Scoring Components

#### 1. Embedding Score (45% weight)
- **Source**: Cosine similarity between transaction and inbox item embeddings
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (1 - cosine_distance)
- **Purpose**: Captures semantic similarity of merchant names, descriptions, and content
- **Fallback**: 0.5 when embeddings are unavailable

#### 2. Amount Score (35% weight)
- **Priority 1**: Exact currency and amount match (1.1x bonus)
- **Priority 2**: Base currency conversion match (1.05x bonus)
- **Priority 3**: Cross-currency base match (1.03x bonus)
- **Tolerance Levels**:
  - Exact match: 1.0
  - ≤1% difference: 0.98
  - ≤2% difference: 0.95
  - ≤5% difference: 0.85
  - ≤10% difference: 0.6
- **Cross-perspective**: Handles invoice (positive) to payment (negative) scenarios

#### 3. Currency Score (15% weight)
- **Same currency**: 1.0
- **Different currency**: 0.5 (assumes conversion capability exists)
- **Missing currency**: 0.5

#### 4. Date Score (5% weight)
- **Document-type aware**: Different logic for invoices vs expenses
- **Banking delay compensation**: Accounts for 3-day open banking delays

##### Invoice Date Logic
- **Payment after invoice** (normal flow):
  - Net 30 (27-35 days): 0.98
  - Net 60 (58-65 days): 0.96
  - Net 90 (88-95 days): 0.94
  - Net 15 (13-17 days): 0.95
  - Net 7 (6-8 days): 0.93
  - Immediate (0-6 days): 0.99
- **Advance payment** (before invoice): 0.85

##### Expense Date Logic
- **Receipt after transaction** (normal flow):
  - Same/next day: 0.99
  - Within week: 0.95
  - Within month: 0.9
  - Within 2 months: 0.8
- **Receipt before transaction**: 0.85 (accounting for banking delay)

### Enhanced Pattern Recognition

Beyond basic scoring, the algorithm applies advanced pattern recognition:

#### Hybrid Scoring for Perfect Financial Matches
Perfect financial matches (exact amount + currency) receive aggressive confidence boosts:
- **Perfect + Strong Semantic** (>0.5 embedding + >0.7 date): 96% confidence minimum
- **Perfect + Decent Semantic** (>0.4 embedding + >0.5 date): 93% confidence minimum
- **Perfect + Moderate Semantic** (>0.5 embedding + >0.3 date): 90% confidence minimum

#### Cross-Currency Intelligence
- **Suspicious Cross-Currency Detection**: Flags potential false positives with large amount differences
- **Cross-Currency Penalties**: Reduces confidence for obviously incorrect cross-currency matches
- **Base Currency Matching**: Handles legitimate cross-currency transactions via base amount comparison

#### Amount Tolerance System
- **Exact Amount Detection**: Strict 0.01 tolerance for "perfect" financial matches
- **Percentage-Based Scoring**: Uses percentage differences for amount similarity scoring
- **Absolute Value Comparison**: Handles invoice (positive) to payment (negative) scenarios correctly

### Thresholds and Match Types

#### Default Thresholds
- **Auto-match**: ≥ 0.95 confidence (very strict, automatically processed)
- **High-confidence suggestion**: ≥ 0.85 confidence
- **Regular suggestion**: ≥ 0.70 confidence
- **No match**: < 0.70 confidence

#### Auto-Match Tiers
Auto-matching uses a tiered approach with different requirements:

**TIER 1: Excellent Matches**
- Confidence ≥ 0.95 (excellent threshold)
- Perfect financial match OR excellent cross-currency match
- Embedding score ≥ 0.8 (strong semantic similarity)
- Date score ≥ 0.8 (good temporal alignment)
- Amount score ≥ 0.25 (some financial correlation)

**TIER 2: High-Confidence Perfect Financial Matches**
- Confidence ≥ 0.9 (high confidence threshold)  
- Perfect financial match OR excellent cross-currency match
- Embedding score ≥ 0.65 (moderate semantic similarity) *[Lowered from 0.7 for perfect financial matches]*
- Date score ≥ 0.5 (decent temporal alignment)

**TIER 3: Conservative Auto-Match for Calibrated Teams**
- Confidence ≥ 0.85 (conservative threshold)
- Team auto-match accuracy > 98% (excellent track record)
- Team has > 20 suggestions (sufficient data)
- Perfect financial match OR excellent cross-currency match
- Embedding score ≥ 0.8 (strong semantic similarity)
- Date score ≥ 0.6 (good temporal alignment)

#### Team-Specific Calibration
Thresholds adapt based on comprehensive user feedback including post-match actions:

```typescript
type TeamCalibrationData = {
  calibratedAutoThreshold: number;      // Learned auto-match threshold
  calibratedSuggestedThreshold: number; // Learned suggestion threshold
  totalSuggestions: number;             // Total suggestions made
  confirmedSuggestions: number;         // User confirmed suggestions
  declinedSuggestions: number;          // User declined suggestions  
  unmatchedSuggestions: number;         // User unmatched after matching (NEW!)
  avgConfidenceConfirmed: number;       // Average confidence of confirmed matches
  avgConfidenceDeclined: number;        // Average confidence of declined matches
  avgConfidenceUnmatched: number;       // Average confidence of unmatched pairs (NEW!)
  autoMatchAccuracy: number;            // Auto-match confirmation rate
  suggestedMatchAccuracy: number;       // Suggestion confirmation rate
  lastUpdated: string;                  // Last calibration update
}
```

#### Conservative Calibration Logic
- **Minimum samples**: 10 for auto-match, 5 for suggestions, 15 for aggressive adjustments
- **Maximum adjustment**: 3% per calibration cycle
- **Conservative approach**: Higher sample requirements prevent premature optimization
- **Comprehensive feedback integration**: 
  - High confirmation rates → lower thresholds (more matches)
  - Low confirmation rates → higher thresholds (fewer false positives)
  - **Post-match unmatching** → treats as negative feedback (like declines)
  - **Confidence gap analysis** → uses combined negative feedback (declined + unmatched)

## Status Flow

### Inbox Item Status Progression
```
new → analyzing → pending → suggested_match/done
                     ↓
                 no_match (after 90 days)
```

### Transaction Match Suggestions Status
```
pending → confirmed/declined/expired/unmatched
```

**Note**: The new `unmatched` status captures when users remove matches after they were initially confirmed or auto-matched, providing crucial negative feedback for the learning system.

### Status Definitions

#### Inbox Item Status
- **new**: Just created, not yet processed
- **analyzing**: Currently being processed (OCR, data extraction)
- **pending**: Processed but no matches found yet
- **suggested_match**: Match suggestion available for user review
- **done**: Successfully matched with a transaction
- **no_match**: No suitable matches found (set by scheduler after 90 days)
- **deleted**: Soft deleted by user

#### Transaction Match Suggestion Status
- **pending**: Suggestion awaiting user action
- **confirmed**: User accepted the suggestion
- **declined**: User rejected the suggestion
- **expired**: Suggestion expired without user action
- **unmatched**: User removed the match after it was confirmed/auto-matched (provides negative learning feedback)

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized for embedding similarity searches

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

- **Auto-match Accuracy**: Percentage of auto-matches confirmed by users
- **Suggestion Accuracy**: Percentage of suggestions confirmed by users  
- **Processing Time**: Time from inbox item creation to match completion
- **Calibration Effectiveness**: Improvement in accuracy over time
- **Tier Performance**: Success rates by query tier

### Logging

Each job provides structured logging with detailed match information:

```typescript
logger.info("Match completed", {
  inboxId,
  transactionId,
  confidence: 0.89,
  matchType: "suggested_match",
  teamId,
  scores: {
    embedding: 0.85,
    amount: 0.95,
    currency: 1.0,
    date: 0.90
  },
  tier: "perfect_financial",
  calibration: {
    autoThreshold: 0.95,
    suggestedThreshold: 0.70
  }
})
```

## Configuration

### Embedding Thresholds
```typescript
const EMBEDDING_THRESHOLDS = {
  PERFECT_MATCH: 0.15,  // Very similar embeddings
  STRONG_MATCH: 0.35,   // Strong semantic similarity  
  GOOD_MATCH: 0.45,     // Moderate similarity
  WEAK_MATCH: 0.6,      // Weak but possible match
}
```

### Calibration Limits
```typescript
const CALIBRATION_LIMITS = {
  MAX_ADJUSTMENT: 0.03,         // Max 3% threshold adjustment per cycle
  MIN_SAMPLES_AUTO: 10,         // Minimum samples for auto-match calibration (conservative)
  MIN_SAMPLES_SUGGESTED: 5,     // Minimum samples for suggestion calibration
  MIN_SAMPLES_CONSERVATIVE: 15, // Higher threshold for aggressive adjustments
}
```

**Note**: Auto-match calibration requires 10 samples (increased from 2) to prevent premature optimization based on lucky streaks. This ensures statistical significance before adjusting auto-match thresholds.

### Date Ranges by Document Type

#### Invoice Matching
- **Perfect range**: 0-33 days after invoice date
- **Conservative range**: 33-48 days after invoice date
- **Accounts for**: Payment terms (Net 7, 15, 30, 60, 90) + banking delays

#### Expense Matching  
- **Perfect range**: 7 days before to 30 days after transaction date
- **Conservative range**: 30-45 days after transaction date
- **Accounts for**: Receipt delays + banking processing time

## Advanced Features

### Duplicate Prevention System
The matching system prevents multiple suggestions for the same transaction using SQL-based filtering:

```sql
-- Prevents suggesting transactions that already have pending suggestions
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM transaction_match_suggestions 
  WHERE transaction_id = transactions.id 
    AND team_id = ? 
    AND status = 'pending'
)
```

**Benefits**:
- **Eliminates confusion**: Users won't see the same transaction suggested for multiple inbox items
- **Improves accuracy**: Reduces false positive suggestions
- **Better UX**: Cleaner suggestion interface without duplicates

### Post-Match Learning System
The system learns from user actions even after matches are completed:

#### Unmatch Feedback Loop
When users unmatch transactions (via delete button), the system:

1. **Identifies original suggestion**: Finds the `transactionMatchSuggestions` record that led to the match
2. **Updates status to "unmatched"**: Marks the suggestion as incorrect post-match feedback
3. **Captures context**: Records user ID, timestamp, and original confidence scores
4. **Feeds into calibration**: Treats unmatched items as negative feedback (like declines)

```typescript
// Example: User unmatches a 96% confidence auto-match
originalSuggestion: {
  status: "unmatched",           // Changed from "confirmed" 
  confidenceScore: 0.96,         // High confidence that was WRONG
  matchType: "auto_matched",     // Was auto-matched
  userActionAt: "2024-08-26",    // When user unmatched
  userId: "user-123"             // Who unmatched
}

// System learns: "96% confidence auto-matches can be wrong"
// Result: More conservative auto-match thresholds
```

#### Learning Impact
- **Immediate**: Unmatched suggestions count as negative feedback in calibration
- **Long-term**: Patterns of unmatched high-confidence matches lead to higher thresholds
- **Team-specific**: Each team's unmatching behavior influences their calibration independently

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- **Missing embeddings**: Falls back to financial matching only with early exit if no embedding available
- **Currency conversion failures**: Uses raw amounts with penalties
- **Date parsing errors**: Uses neutral date scores
- **Database timeouts**: Retries with simpler queries

### Retry Logic
- **Embedding failures**: Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Query timeouts**: Fall back to simpler tier-by-tier approach
- **Calibration errors**: Use default thresholds as fallback

## Future Enhancements
