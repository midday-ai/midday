## About

This documentation provides in-depth technical details about core Midday features and algorithms. It's intended for developers working on the codebase who need to understand the implementation details, data flows, and architectural decisions.

The documentation here is kept in sync with the actual implementation and provides more technical depth than the user-facing documentation in the apps/docs directory.
