# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Solomon-AI API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Solomon-AI offers two ways to authenticate your API requests: Basic authentication and OAuth2 with a token — OAuth2 is the recommended way. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Basic authentication

With basic authentication, you use your username and password to authenticate your HTTP requests. Unless you have a very good reason, you probably shouldn't use basic auth. Here's how to authenticate using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with basic auth' }}
curl https://api.Solomon-AI.chat/v1/conversations \
  -u username:password
```

Please don't commit your Solomon-AI password to GitHub!

## OAuth2 with bearer token

The recommended way to authenticate with the Solomon-AI API is by using OAuth2. When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [Solomon-AI dashboard](solomon-ai.io) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://api.Solomon-AI.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.

## Using an SDK

If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the [Solomon-AI dashboard](solomon-ai.io) under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
