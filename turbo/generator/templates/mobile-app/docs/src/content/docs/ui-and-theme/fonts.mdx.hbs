With Expo, you can load fonts dynamically using `useFont` hook from `expo-font` library. With this approach, you need to wait for the font to load before showing or hiding your splash screen.

With the last version of `expo-font` introduced with Expo 50, you can use `expo-font` as a plugin in your `app.config.js` to load fonts natively.

To add a custom font you only need to put the font file in the `assets/fonts` and update the expo config by adding the exact file path to the config like the following:

```js title="app.config.js"
import type { ConfigContext, ExpoConfig } from '@expo/config';

export default ({ config }: ConfigContext): ExpoConfig => ({
  ...config,
  plugins: [
    [
      'expo-font',
      {
        fonts: ['./assets/fonts/Inter.ttf'],
      },
    ],
  ],
});
```

Next, Make sure to add your new font to Tailwind CSS config to use it with `className`

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
const colors = require('./src/ui/theme/colors');

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  // NOTE: Update this to include the paths to all of your component files.
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  presets: [require('nativewind/preset')],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        inter: ['Inter'],
      },
      colors,
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

:::info
As we are linking font natively you need to run `expo prebuild` and then `expo ios` or `expo android` to use the new font.
