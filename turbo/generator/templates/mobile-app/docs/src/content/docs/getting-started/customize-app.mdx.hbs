import Code from '../../../components/code.astro';

The starter is a simple expo app. You just need to edit `app.config.ts` file to update expo attributes and configuration.

Here is the complete config file :

<Code file="app.config.ts" />

You can read more about expo configuration [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/configuration/).
If you have any configurations that depend on environment variables, such as API URLs or keys, you can create it in `config` file following [the environment variables guide](./environment-vars-config) and import your config to `app.config.ts` file.

:::note
We included TODO comments in the project to guide you to the areas requiring updates.

## Splash screen and app icon

As we are using expo to create the starter, updating the app icon and splash screen is straightforward. You only need to update the app icon and splash screen images inside the `assets` folder and run `expo prebuild` to update the app icon and splash screen.

As we are supporting multiple variants for development, staging and production environments you need 3 different icons but the right solution is to use the same icon with badges for each environment.

For more details about the app icon and splash screen, please refer to the expo documentation.
