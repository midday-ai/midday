# ✍️ Description:
# This action is used to run the type-check on the project.
# Runs on pull requests and pushes to  the main/master branches
# Based on the event type:
#   - If it's a pull request, it will run type checking, then add the check to the PR as well as annotate the code with the errors using reviewdog.
#   - If it's a push to main/master, it will run the type checking and fail if there are any errors.
