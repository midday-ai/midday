# Starter releasing process: https://starter.obytes.com/ci-cd/app-releasing-process/

# ✍️ Description:
# This workflow is used to create a new version of the app and push a new tag to the repo.
# As this workflow will push code to the repo, we set up GitHub Bot as a Git user.
# This Workflow need to be triggered manually from the Actions tab in the repo.
#         1. Choose your release type (patch, minor, major)
#         2. The workflow will run the np-release script which runs the following steps:
#             - Bump the version in package.json based on the release type using np
#             - Run the prebuild of the app to align the package.json version with the native code
#             - Create a new tag with the new version
#             - Push the new tag to the repo
#

# 🚨 GITHUB SECRETS REQUIRED:
#         - GH_TOKEN: A GitHub token with write repo access.
#           You can generate one from here: https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
#           make sure to add it to the repo secrets with the name GH_TOKEN
