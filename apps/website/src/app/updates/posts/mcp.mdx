Introducing MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for Midday. Now you can connect your favorite AI tools directly to your business data—ask questions about cash flow, invoices, customers, and get answers grounded in real numbers.

<br />

### What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that lets AI applications access external data sources securely. Instead of copy-pasting numbers into ChatGPT or describing your finances to Claude, your AI tools can now query Midday directly.

<br />

### Skip the Dashboards

With MCP, you can ask natural questions and get instant answers:

- "How much runway do we have at current burn rate?"
- "Which invoices are overdue and by how much?"
- "What did we spend on software last quarter?"
- "Show me revenue compared to last year"
- "Who are our top customers by revenue?"

<br />

No more digging through dashboards. Just ask.

<br />

### Supported Clients

We support the AI tools you're already using:

- **[Cursor](/mcp/cursor)** - Track time and expenses while you code. Ask about your business without leaving your editor.
- **[Claude](/mcp/claude)** - Analyze trends and get insights. Have conversations grounded in your real business data.

### Secure by Design

Security was a top priority. Access is controlled through **granular API key permissions**—you decide whether your AI can read data, create invoices, manage customers, or track time. Every action respects your configured scopes, so you're always in control.
