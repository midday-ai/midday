I’m incredibly excited to announce that our most requested feature is finally here—Invoicing!  Let’s dive into how it works and what we’re focusing on for the next month.
<br />

 
## Invoicing

<br />
We have designed and developed a new visual editor from the ground up, based on extensive research and feedback from early users. While it may look simple, it’s incredibly powerful for all your needs. 
<br />
Here are some features we support from the start:

- Edit and change labels and names
- Rich text editor for content, including links, bold, italic, and more
- AI-enhanced editor with grammar assistance
- Date formats, currencies, VAT, sales tax, discounts, QR codes

<br />
And much more!

<br />
## Web invoice

<br />
You can choose to send an email to your customers with the newly created invoice. This will open a web-based invoice where they can communicate in real-time instead of exchanging emails back and forth. 
<br />
They can also download a PDF, and as the owner, you can see the last view date.

<br />
<br />

## Invoice status

<br />
If you have a bank account connected to Midday, we will automatically mark an invoice as paid when we find a match. You’ll be notified, and the generated PDF will be attached to your transaction for bookkeeping.<br />

<br />
You’ll also be notified when invoices become overdue, allowing you to send a reminder email with the press of a button.
<br />



## What's coming next
 
#### Stability and improvements 
Our main focus right now is to prepare Midday for our v1 release in Q1 next year. We’re working on our banking integrations to handle various edge cases more effectively, ironing out all the small bugs, and improving the overall experience with Midday.

If you find any bugs or have any feedback, just let us know!
