Running a business means constantly checking numbers, chasing invoices, and trying to make sense of what's actually happening. We built Weekly Insights to give you that clarity in 30 seconds.

<br />

### Your Week, At a Glance

Every week, Midday analyzes your transactions, invoices, and financial data to create a personalized summary. No dashboards to dig through—just the numbers that matter:

- **Profit, revenue, and expenses** with week-over-week comparisons
- **Your runway** as a specific date, not just months ("until March 15" hits different than "3 months")
- **Who owes you money** with exact amounts and company names
- **What to do next** with prioritized recommendations

<br />

### Smarter Than a Spreadsheet

Weekly Insights doesn't just report numbers—it understands context:

- **Streak detection**: "Third consecutive profitable week" or early warnings like "Second week of declining revenue"
- **Year-over-year comparisons**: See how this week stacks up against the same week last year
- **Quarter pace projections**: Know if you're on track for your quarterly goals
- **Payment anomalies**: If a normally fast-paying customer is unusually late, you'll know about it

<br />

### Listen Instead of Read

Prefer audio? Your weekly insight is also available as a short voice summary. Listen while commuting, exercising, or grabbing coffee. Same key points—profit, runway, actions—in a natural, conversational tone.

<br />

### Actions, Not Just Information

Every insight ends with specific recommendations:

- "Collect $7,500 from Acme Corp"
- "Review Travel expenses ($2,500, +100%)"
- "Diversify—100% revenue from one customer"

These aren't generic tips. They're specific to your business, this week.

<br />

### How It Works

1. **Connect your accounts** — Bank accounts, invoices, and transactions sync automatically
2. **Wait for Monday** — New insights generate weekly
3. **Check your inbox** — Get notified when your insight is ready
4. **Take action** — Follow up on that overdue invoice, review that expense spike

<br />

### Available Now

Weekly Insights is rolling out to all Midday users. If you don't see it yet, you will soon.

We're excited to hear how this helps you stay on top of your business. As always, feedback is welcome—we read every message.
