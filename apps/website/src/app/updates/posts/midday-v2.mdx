Today we're releasing Midday v2—our biggest update ever.

When we started building Midday, the goal was simple: one place to manage your business finances without the spreadsheet chaos. With v2, we're taking that further. This isn't just an update—it's a complete evolution of how Midday works.

Here's what's new.

<br />

## Your new financial co-pilot

#### AI Assistant

We rebuilt the Assistant from scratch. It's faster, smarter, and actually useful for the questions you ask every day.

Ask *"How's my cash flow looking?"* and get a visual answer in seconds. Ask *"Where am I overspending?"* and see a breakdown by category. The Assistant now generates interactive charts, financial reports, and forecasts—not just text responses.

And it remembers. Your conversation history is saved, so you can pick up where you left off or reference past insights.

- **Interactive canvas:** Charts, reports, and visualizations generated on demand
- **Financial analysis:** Health reports, runway forecasts, stress tests, spending breakdowns
- **Voice input:** Ask questions hands-free
- **Chat history:** Conversations persist across sessions

<br />

#### Dashboard

Your new home in Midday. We've completely redesigned the dashboard to show you exactly what matters—at a glance.

Choose from 20+ widgets: cash flow, runway, profit margins, outstanding invoices, revenue forecasts, tax summaries, top customers, and more. Arrange them however you want. The data updates in real-time.

- **Customizable layout:** Drag, drop, resize—make it yours
- **Metrics view:** Detailed breakdowns when you need to dig deeper
- **Smart suggestions:** Actions recommended based on your financial state
- **Live data:** Always current, never stale

<br />

#### Apps & Integrations

Midday now connects to everything. We've built a complete app platform with 15+ integrations ready to go.

One click to connect. No complicated setup. Your tools talk to each other.

**Connect your stack:**
- **Accounting:** Xero, QuickBooks, Fortnox—export transactions and attachments automatically
- **Communication:** Slack notifications, WhatsApp receipt capture, Gmail and Outlook inbox sync
- **Payments:** Stripe—accept cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay on invoices
- **Storage:** Google Drive, Dropbox
- **Productivity:** Cal, Zapier, Raycast

Each integration is configurable. Get notified in Slack when a payment comes in. Forward a receipt via WhatsApp and watch it match to the right transaction. Export to your accountant's preferred software with one click.

#### Recurring Invoices

Stop recreating the same invoice every month.

Set up a recurring schedule—weekly, monthly, quarterly, or custom—and Midday handles the rest. Invoices go out automatically. Payments get tracked. You get notified when money lands.

We've also added invoice templates. Save your standard payment details, notes, and formatting once. Use them forever.

- **Flexible scheduling:** Any cadence that fits your clients
- **Automatic delivery:** On time, every time
- **Online payments:** Clients pay directly from the invoice via Stripe
- **Templates:** One-click invoicing with your saved details

<br />

#### Everything else

This release includes hundreds of improvements under the hood:

- **Customer enrichment:** AI fills in company details, LinkedIn profiles, funding info
- **Inbox upgrades:** Bulk actions, smart grouping, better document extraction
- **Performance:** ~70% faster in the US with new infrastructure
- **New website:** Fresh design at midday.ai
