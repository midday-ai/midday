We're excited to introduce Abacus — the operating system for funding businesses.

<br />

#### Why We Built This

Funding operators have been stuck between expensive enterprise software and fragile spreadsheets. We built Abacus to bridge that gap: connect your existing data sources and get a professional portfolio management system in minutes.

<br />

#### What's Included

- **Portfolio Dashboard** — Real-time view of your funded deals, RTR balances, and payment performance
- **Merchant Portal** — Branded portal where merchants can view their payment schedules and history
- **Bank Connection** — Connect merchant bank accounts to monitor payment activity
- **Proactive Alerts** — Get notified about NSFs, late payments, and risk changes before they become problems

<br />

#### Our Philosophy: Push, Don't Pull

Abacus proactively surfaces the information you need rather than making you dig for it. Weekly portfolio summaries, real-time alerts, and "3 merchants need attention" notifications — not passive dashboards you have to remember to check.

<br />

#### What's Next

We're just getting started. Coming soon:

- Risk scoring and trend analysis
- Automated payment reconciliation
- ISO commission tracking
- Mobile app for on-the-go portfolio monitoring

<br />

We'd love to hear from you. Reply to this post or reach out directly with feedback.
