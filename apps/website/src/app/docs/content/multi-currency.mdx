Midday supports businesses operating in multiple currencies. Connect accounts in different currencies, track international transactions, and see unified reports in your base currency.

## Base currency

Your base currency is the primary currency for your business. All reports and metrics are displayed in this currency.

### Set your base currency

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Find **Base Currency**
3. Select your currency from the dropdown
4. Save

Choose the currency you use for:
- Most of your revenue
- Tax reporting
- Day-to-day operations

### When to change base currency

Only change your base currency if your business fundamentally shifts operations. Changing it affects how all historical data is displayed in reports.

## Multi-currency accounts

You can connect bank accounts in any currency Midday supports.

### Connecting accounts in different currencies

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Click **Connect bank**
3. Select your bank and authenticate
4. Choose which accounts to connect

Each account retains its native currency. A EUR account shows EUR transactions and balances.

### Viewing account balances

In your accounts list, each account shows:
- Balance in the account's native currency
- Converted balance in your base currency (for reference)

## Exchange rates

Midday uses market exchange rates to convert currencies.

### How conversion works

When displaying multi-currency data in reports:

1. **Transactions**: Converted using the exchange rate on the transaction date
2. **Balances**: Converted using the current exchange rate
3. **Reports**: All amounts converted to your base currency

### Exchange rate sources

Midday uses reliable market rates updated daily. Rates are for display purposes and may differ slightly from your bank's rates.

## Reports with multiple currencies

All reports display in your base currency for easy comparison.

### Revenue and profit

- Revenue from all currencies is converted and summed
- Expenses in foreign currencies are converted
- Profit shows the combined result in base currency

### Burn rate and runway

- Calculated using converted amounts
- Gives you one unified view of cash consumption
- Runway uses total cash across all currencies

### Transaction list

In the transaction list, you can:
- See the original amount and currency
- Filter by currency
- View the converted amount in base currency

## Invoicing in multiple currencies

Create invoices in any currency your customers prefer.

### Setting invoice currency

1. Create a new invoice
2. Select the customer
3. Choose the invoice currency
4. Enter amounts in that currency

The invoice displays in the selected currency. When paid, the revenue converts to your base currency for reports.

### Customer currency preferences

When you add a customer, you can set their default currency. New invoices for that customer will use this currency automatically.

## Tips for multi-currency businesses

### Organize by currency

Use tags to organize transactions by currency or region:
- `EUR transactions`
- `US operations`
- `UK clients`

### Monitor exchange rate impact

If you have significant foreign currency holdings, exchange rate changes affect your reported cash position. Review regularly.

### Match currencies when possible

Where practical, invoice customers in currencies that match your expenses in that region. This creates a natural hedge.

### Keep records

For tax purposes, you may need to track original currency amounts. Midday stores both the original and converted amounts for every transaction.

## Supported currencies

Midday supports all major world currencies including:

- USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF
- CAD, AUD, NZD
- SEK, NOK, DKK
- And many more

The available currencies depend on your connected banks and payment processors.
