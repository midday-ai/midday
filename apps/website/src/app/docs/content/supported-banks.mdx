### Open Banking (OAuth)

- You authenticate directly with your bank
- Midday never sees your login credentials
- Read-only access to transactions

### Credential-based

Some banks require credentials:

- Encrypted and stored securely
- Used only to sync transactions
- Can be removed at any time

## Check your bank

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Click **Connect bank**
3. Search for your bank by name

If you don't find your bank:

- Try the full official name
- Check for separate business banking
- Use [CSV import](/docs/import-transactions-csv) as a fallback

## Business vs. personal banking

Some banks have separate platforms for business accounts:

- Search for "Business" or "Commercial" versions
- Business accounts may have different connection requirements
- Contact your bank if unsure which platform you use

## Connection limits

Depending on your plan:

- Free: Limited number of connected accounts
- Pro: More connected accounts
- Check your plan details for specifics

## Requesting a bank

If your bank isn't supported:

1. Email [support@midday.ai](mailto:support@midday.ai) with bank name and country
2. We'll check if it can be added
3. Some regional banks have limited API availability
