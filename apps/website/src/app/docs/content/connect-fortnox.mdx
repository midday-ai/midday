- VAT/moms if applicable

### Attachments

## Exporting transactions

1. Go to the **Review** tab in [Transactions](https://app.midday.ai/transactions)
2. Select the transactions you want to export (or export all)
3. Click **Export** and choose **Fortnox**

## Swedish accounting considerations

### VAT/Moms handling

- Midday tracks VAT amounts when available
- Maps to appropriate Fortnox VAT codes
- Review VAT settings in your Fortnox configuration

### BAS account structure

Fortnox uses the Swedish BAS standard:

- **1xxx**: Assets
- **2xxx**: Liabilities and equity
- **3xxx**: Revenue
- **4xxx**: Cost of goods sold
- **5-6xxx**: Operating expenses
- **7xxx**: Depreciation and financial items
- **8xxx**: Financial income/expenses

Midday's category structure aligns with this for straightforward mapping.

### Fiscal year

Ensure your fiscal year settings match between Midday and Fortnox for accurate reporting.

## Troubleshooting

### Export errors

If transactions fail to export:

- Check that the Fortnox connection is active in [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
- Verify transactions are categorized (uncategorized transactions can't export)
- Check category mappings are complete

### Mapping errors

If transactions appear in the wrong account:

1. Review category mappings in Fortnox settings
2. Re-categorize affected transactions in Midday
3. Export again

### Reconnecting

If the connection expires:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Reconnect** on Fortnox
3. Re-authorize with your Fortnox credentials

Fortnox connections may need periodic re-authorization for security.

## Disconnect

To remove the connection:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Disconnect** on Fortnox
3. Confirm disconnection

Previously exported data remains in Fortnox. New transactions won't export.

## Working with your accountant

### Before connecting

- Discuss category mappings with your accountant
- Agree on which accounts transactions should flow to
- Set up the appropriate BAS accounts in Fortnox

### Ongoing workflow

1. Transactions arrive and receipts are matched automatically

4. Your accountant reviews in Fortnox for final adjustments

### Year-end
