## vs. Web app

Both the desktop and web app provide the same features. Choose based on your preference:

| Feature | Desktop App | Web App |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Access | Menu bar | Browser tab |
| Notifications | Native OS notifications | Browser notifications |
| Offline | Limited offline access | Requires internet |
| Updates | Auto-updates | Always current |

Many users use both—the desktop app for daily work and time tracking, and the web app when on shared computers.
