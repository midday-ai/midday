Weekly Insights gives you a clear picture of how your business performed each week. Instead of digging through transactions and reports yourself, you get a concise summary with the numbers that matter and specific actions to take.

## Why weekly insights matter

Running a business means juggling many things. Weekly Insights helps you:

- **Stay informed in 30 seconds**: Know if your week was good or bad without spreadsheets
- **Catch problems early**: Spot declining revenue or rising expenses before they become crises
- **Know exactly who owes you money**: See every overdue invoice with amounts and company names
- **Understand your runway**: Not just "3 months" but "until April 15"—a date you can plan around
- **Get actionable next steps**: Specific recommendations, not generic advice

## What you'll see each week

Your weekly insight includes several sections:

### Summary

A 2-3 sentence overview of your week covering:

- Profit, revenue, and expenses
- Your margin percentage
- How long your cash will last (with a specific date)
- Any outstanding receivables worth noting

**Example:**
> "You earned $5,644 profit on $7,500 revenue this week, with a margin of 75.3% and expenses at $1,855, giving you a runway lasting until February 24. Note that $22,500 remains overdue from three clients."

### Key Metrics

The four most important numbers for your week, automatically selected based on what changed and what matters most:

| Metric | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| Profit | What you kept after expenses |
| Revenue | What came in |
| Expenses | What went out |
| Profit Margin | How efficiently you turn revenue into profit |
| Cash Flow | Net money movement |
| Runway | How long your cash lasts |

Each metric shows:
- The current value
- Change from last week (percentage and direction)

### Recommended Actions

A prioritized list of 3-5 things to focus on. Actions are ordered by importance:

1. **Overdue invoices first**: Collecting money you're already owed
2. **Expense concerns**: Unusual spending spikes to investigate
3. **Business health**: Diversification, unbilled work, or other strategic items

**Example actions:**
- Collect $7,500 from Acme Corp
- Review Travel expenses ($2,500, +100%)
- Diversify—100% revenue from one customer

### Highlight Story

A brief narrative about the most notable aspect of your week:

- Milestones: "Best profit week since October"
- Streaks: "Third consecutive profitable week"
- Recoveries: "Back in profit after two down weeks"
- Payment wins: "All invoices paid on time for 5 weeks"

## Understanding your runway date

One of the most useful parts of Weekly Insights is seeing exactly when your cash runs out—not just "3 months" but a specific date like "March 15, 2026."

This helps you:
- **Set real deadlines**: "I need to close a deal by March 1"
- **Plan fundraising**: Know exactly when conversations need to conclude
- **Prioritize collections**: See how collecting one invoice extends your date

The date updates each week based on your current cash and spending rate.

## Trends and patterns

Weekly Insights tracks patterns across multiple weeks:

### Streaks

When something happens consistently, you'll see it called out:

| Streak | When it appears |
|--------|-----------------|
| Profitable weeks | 3+ consecutive weeks with positive profit |
| Revenue growth | 3+ consecutive weeks of increasing revenue |
| Revenue decline | 2+ consecutive weeks of declining revenue (early warning) |
| Invoices paid on time | 3+ weeks where all invoices were paid on time |

Revenue decline is highlighted after just 2 weeks because catching this early matters.

### Year-over-year comparison

When you have enough historical data, you'll see how this week compares to the same week last year:

> "Revenue up 35% vs last year"

This helps you understand if changes are seasonal or represent real growth.

### Quarter pace

Midway through a quarter, you'll see projections:

> "On pace for $450,000 this Q1—18% ahead of Q1 last year"

This helps you gauge progress toward quarterly goals.

## Payment alerts

If a customer who normally pays quickly is unusually late, you'll see a flag:

> "Acme Corp: $7,500 overdue—unusual delay, they typically pay in 5 days"

This helps you prioritize follow-ups. A normally reliable customer being late might indicate a problem worth a phone call, while a habitually slow payer being a few days late is less concerning.

## Different week types

Weekly Insights adapts its tone and focus based on how your week went:

| Week Type | What you'll see |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Great week | Celebration of wins, forward-looking suggestions |
| Good week | Balanced overview, areas for improvement |
| Quiet week | Reassurance that slow weeks are normal, focus on existing receivables |
| Challenging week | Honest assessment, emphasis on runway, prioritized recovery actions |

For quiet weeks with no activity, you won't see misleading "down 100% from last week" language. Instead, the summary acknowledges it was slow and focuses on what you can control (like collecting receivables).

## Listen instead of read

Your weekly insight is also available as a short audio summary you can listen to instead of reading. This is useful when you:

- Want a quick update while commuting or exercising
- Prefer hands-free consumption of information
- Are checking in from your phone

The audio summary covers the same key points—profit, runway, overdue invoices, and recommended actions—in a natural, conversational tone. Just tap play on the audio player in your insight.

## When insights are generated

New insights are generated weekly, typically Sunday evening or Monday morning. You'll receive:

- A notification in Midday
- An email summary (if enabled in notification settings)
- An audio version you can play anytime

## Getting the most from insights

### Keep your data current

The better your data, the better your insights:

- **Connect all business accounts**: Missing accounts mean incomplete picture
- **Categorize transactions**: Helps identify expense patterns
- **Mark invoices as paid**: Keeps receivables accurate
- **Update invoice status**: Cancel invoices that won't be collected

### Review weekly

Spend 2 minutes each Monday:

1. Read the summary—any surprises?
2. Check the key metrics—anything unusual?
3. Review actions—can you tackle the top one today?

### Act on recommendations

The actions aren't generic advice—they're specific to your business this week. Following up on an overdue invoice often takes just one email.

## First week insights

Your first insight won't have comparison data, so you'll see:

- Current metrics without percentage changes
- "This period" instead of "vs last week"
- A welcome message explaining what to expect

After a few weeks, you'll start seeing trends, comparisons, and pattern detection.

## Multi-currency support

If you operate in multiple currencies:

- All metrics are shown in your base currency
- Invoice amounts appear in their original currency
- Exchange rates are current as of insight generation

Set your base currency in [Settings](https://app.midday.ai/settings).

## Privacy and data

Your insights are generated using AI, but:

- Data never leaves Midday's secure infrastructure
- No third parties see your financial details
- Insights are only visible to your team members
