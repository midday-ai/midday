If your bank isn't supported for automatic sync, you can import transactions manually via CSV.

## When to use CSV import

- Your bank isn't in our supported list
- You have transactions from before connecting your bank
- You're migrating from another tool
- You need to import credit card statements

## Prepare your CSV

Your CSV file should include:

- **Date**: Transaction date
- **Description**: Merchant or transaction description
- **Amount**: Transaction amount (positive for income, negative for expenses—or vice versa)

Optional columns:

- Category
- Notes
- Reference number

Most bank exports work directly. Midday maps common formats automatically.

## Import transactions

1. Go to [Transactions](https://app.midday.ai/transactions)
2. Click **Import** or the import icon
3. Select your CSV file
4. Map columns to Midday fields
5. Review the preview
6. Confirm import

## Column mapping

If Midday doesn't recognize your columns automatically:

1. Match each CSV column to a Midday field
2. Specify date format if needed
3. Indicate if amounts are inverted (positive = expense)

## After import

Imported transactions:

- Appear in your transaction list
- Are categorized by AI automatically
- Can be edited like any other transaction
- Won't duplicate if you later connect the same bank

## Tips

- Export from your bank in CSV format, not PDF
- Include as much history as useful (usually 1 year)
- Review categories after import—AI needs to learn your patterns
- Consider connecting the bank after import to avoid future manual work

## Troubleshooting

### Date parsing errors

- Check your date format matches what you selected
- Common formats: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD

### Duplicate transactions

- Midday checks for duplicates based on date, amount, and description
- Exact duplicates are skipped
- Near-duplicates might import—delete manually if needed

### Missing columns

- Only Date, Description, and Amount are required
- Other data can be added to transactions after import
