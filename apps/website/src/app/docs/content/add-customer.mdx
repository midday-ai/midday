   - **Email**: For sending invoices
   - **Address**: For invoices (optional)
   - **VAT number**: For tax purposes (optional)

   - Industry
   - Company size

## Edit a customer

1. Go to [Customers](https://app.midday.ai/customers)
2. Click on the customer
3. Edit their details

Changes apply to future invoices. Past invoices keep their original details.

## Delete a customer

Customers can only be deleted if they have no invoices or projects. To remove:

1. Delete or reassign any invoices
2. Remove from any projects
3. Then delete the customer

Usually it's better to just keep old customers for records.

## Using customers

Once added, customers appear in:

- **Invoices**: Select when creating an invoice
- **Projects**: Link projects to customers
- **Reports**: Filter by customer

## Tips

- Add customers before your first invoice to them
- Keep email addresses current for delivery
- Use notes for payment preferences or special terms
