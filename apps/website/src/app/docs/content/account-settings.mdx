Your connected bank accounts are the foundation of Midday. This guide explains how to manage accounts and how your settings affect financial metrics.

## View your accounts

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. See all connected accounts with their:
   - Account name and bank
   - Current balance
   - Account type
   - Connection status
   - Enabled/disabled state

## Account types

Midday categorizes accounts by type, which affects how they're used in financial calculations:

| Type | Examples | Counts as Cash | Used in Reports |
|------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Depository | Checking, Savings | Yes | Cash balance, Runway |
| Other Asset | Money Market, Treasury | Yes | Cash balance, Runway |
| Credit | Credit Cards | No | Net position (debt), Balance sheet |
| Loan | Business Loans | No | Balance sheet |

### Why account types matter

Your **runway** calculation uses only cash accounts (depository + other asset). Credit cards and loans don't extend your runway—they're debt.

Your **burn rate** includes transactions from all enabled accounts.

Your **net position** shows cash minus credit card debt, giving you a realistic picture of your financial position.

## Enable and disable accounts

You can enable or disable any connected account.

### To disable an account

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Find the account
3. Toggle the **Enabled** switch off

### Effects of disabling

When you disable an account:

- **Balance excluded**: The account's balance won't count toward cash balance or runway
- **Transactions hidden**: Transactions from this account won't appear in lists by default
- **Reports affected**: Financial reports exclude this account's data
- **History preserved**: Past data remains; re-enable anytime to restore

### When to disable accounts

Common reasons to disable:

- **Closed accounts**: Keep historical data but exclude from current metrics
- **Personal accounts**: If you accidentally connected a personal account
- **Inactive accounts**: Accounts you no longer use actively
- **Test accounts**: Sandbox or test accounts

## Connect a new account

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Click **Connect bank**
3. Search for your bank
4. Complete the secure authentication
5. Select which accounts to connect

### What gets synced

When you connect an account:

- **Historical transactions**: Usually 90 days of past transactions
- **Current balance**: Updated with each sync
- **Account details**: Name, type, currency

New transactions sync automatically, typically within minutes of clearing your bank.

## Reconnect an account

Bank connections sometimes need re-authentication. You'll see a notification when this happens.

### To reconnect

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Find the account with a connection issue
3. Click **Reconnect**
4. Complete the authentication with your bank

### Why reconnection is needed

- **Security**: Banks require periodic re-authorization (often every 90 days)
- **Password changes**: If you changed your bank password
- **Bank updates**: Banks sometimes update their security systems

## Manual accounts

For banks that aren't supported for automatic sync, you can create manual accounts.

### Create a manual account

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Click **Add manual account**
3. Enter:
   - Account name
   - Account type
   - Currency
   - Current balance
4. Save

### Managing manual accounts

- **Update balance**: Manually update the balance periodically
- **Import transactions**: Import via CSV
- **Same features**: Manual accounts work like connected accounts for reporting

## Delete a connection

To completely remove a bank connection:

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Find the connection
3. Click **Delete connection**
4. Confirm deletion

### What happens when you delete

- **Transaction history**: Option to keep or delete historical transactions
- **Connection removed**: The bank link is severed
- **Cannot undo**: You'll need to reconnect to restore

Consider **disabling** instead if you want to keep historical data but exclude from current metrics.

## Currency settings

### Account currency

Each account has a currency based on the bank account's denomination. This is set automatically when you connect.

### Base currency

Your team's base currency is used for:

- Displaying totals across accounts
- Converting foreign currency transactions
- Financial reports and metrics

Set your base currency in [Settings](https://app.midday.ai/settings).

### Multi-currency handling

If you have accounts in different currencies:

1. Each account's balance is shown in its native currency
2. Totals are converted to your base currency
3. Exchange rates are updated regularly
4. Transaction amounts show both original and converted values

## Troubleshooting

### Account balance doesn't match bank

- **Pending transactions**: Some transactions may not have cleared
- **Sync delay**: Wait a few minutes and check again
- **Force sync**: Click the sync button to refresh

### Missing transactions

- **Sync timing**: Transactions appear when they clear (not when pending)
- **Account disabled**: Check the account is enabled
- **Date range**: Check you're looking at the right date range

### Connection keeps failing

- **Bank maintenance**: Try again later
- **Credentials changed**: You may need to reconnect with new credentials
- **Bank not supported**: Some smaller banks have limited API support

### Wrong account type

If an account is categorized incorrectly:

1. The type is set automatically based on bank data
2. Contact support if it's clearly wrong
3. This affects which metrics the account contributes to

## Best practices

1. **Connect all business accounts**: Complete data means accurate metrics
2. **Disable, don't delete**: Keep historical data by disabling inactive accounts
3. **Check connections regularly**: Reconnect before they expire
4. **Use manual accounts sparingly**: Automatic sync is more reliable
5. **Set base currency correctly**: Ensures accurate multi-currency totals

## Privacy and security

- **Read-only access**: Midday can only view transactions, never move money
- **Bank-level security**: OAuth authentication with major banks
- **Encrypted storage**: Account credentials and data are encrypted
- **You control access**: Disconnect anytime
