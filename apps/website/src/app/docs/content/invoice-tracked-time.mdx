Convert tracked time directly into invoices. No manual calculation needed.

## Create an invoice from time

1. Go to [Time Tracking](https://app.midday.ai/tracker)
2. Select the project or time entries to invoice
3. Click **Create invoice** (or select the entries to include)
4. Review the pre-filled invoice:
   - Customer from project
   - Line items from time entries
   - Amounts calculated from hours × rate
5. Edit if needed
6. Send

## What's included

Each time entry becomes a line item:

- **Description**: From your entry description
- **Hours**: Duration of the entry
- **Rate**: From the project or entry
- **Amount**: Hours × rate

Multiple entries can be combined or kept separate.

## Grouping options

When creating the invoice, choose how to present time:

- **Detailed**: Each entry as a separate line item
- **Grouped**: Combine entries by date or description
- **Summary**: Single line with total hours

Pick what makes sense for your client relationship.

## Partial invoicing

You don't have to invoice all time at once:

1. Select only the entries to invoice
2. Remaining time stays available for future invoices

Useful for:

- Billing portions of ongoing work
- Separating billable phases
- Matching client purchase orders

## Mark time as invoiced

When you create an invoice from time:

- Entries are marked as invoiced
- They won't appear in future "uninvoiced" filters
- You can still see them in the project history

## Tips

- Review time entries before invoicing—clean up descriptions
- Confirm rates are correct for the project
- Add a note on the invoice if billing terms differ from tracked time
