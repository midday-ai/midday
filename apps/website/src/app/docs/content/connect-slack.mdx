Connect your Slack workspace to share receipts and documents directly to your Midday inbox. Great for teams where receipts often come through Slack.

## How it works

Once connected:

1. Share any file to a designated Slack channel
2. The file appears in your Midday inbox
3. AI processes and attempts to match it to transactions
4. Review and confirm matches as usual

## Connect Slack

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Find Slack in the integrations section
3. Click **Connect Slack**
4. Authorize Midday to access your workspace
5. Select or create a channel for receipts

## Choose a channel

You can use:

- **An existing channel**: Use a channel your team already shares receipts in
- **A new channel**: Create a dedicated `#receipts` or `#expenses` channel

Only files shared in the connected channel will be sent to Midday.

## Sharing files

Once connected, sharing is simple:

1. Open Slack
2. Go to the connected channel
3. Share a file (drag and drop, or use the attachment button)
4. The file automatically appears in your Midday inbox

### Supported files

- Images (photos of receipts)
- PDFs (digital receipts, invoices)
- Common document formats

### What happens next

1. The file appears in your [Inbox](https://app.midday.ai/inbox)
2. AI extracts merchant, amount, and date
3. Matching against transactions begins
4. You'll see it as "pending" or "suggested match"

## Use cases

### Team expense capture

Multiple team members can share receipts to one channel. All receipts flow into the same Midday inbox for processing.

### Mobile receipt capture

Take a photo of a receipt on your phone, share it to Slack, and it's in Midday—no need to open the Midday app.

### Vendor communication

If vendors send receipts or invoices via Slack, forward them to the connected channel.

## Multiple workspaces

If you have multiple Slack workspaces, you can connect one per Midday team. Switch teams in Midday to manage different workspace connections.

## Disconnect Slack

To stop the integration:

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Find the Slack connection
3. Click **Disconnect**

Files already in your inbox remain; new files won't sync.

## Troubleshooting

### Files not appearing in Midday

- Verify the file was shared in the connected channel
- Check that the Slack connection is still active
- Try sharing a different file to test

### Can't find the channel

- Make sure you have permission to access the channel
- The channel must be one Midday was authorized to access

### Reconnecting

If the connection breaks:

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Reconnect** next to Slack
3. Re-authorize the connection

## Privacy and permissions

- Midday only receives files shared in the connected channel
- We can't read other channels or direct messages
- The integration is read-only—Midday can't post to Slack
- You can disconnect anytime
