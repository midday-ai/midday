The Midday assistant is also available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), letting you use it in compatible tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. With MCP, you can query your Midday data from:

- Claude Desktop
- Cursor IDE
- Other MCP-compatible applications

## Setting up MCP

### Prerequisites

- A Midday account with an API key
- An MCP-compatible application

### Get your API key

1. Go to [Settings → Developer](https://app.midday.ai/settings/developer)
2. Click **Create API key**
3. Copy the key (you won't see it again)

### Configure your MCP client

Add Midday to your MCP configuration. The exact setup varies by client.

For Claude Desktop, add to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "midday": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@midday-ai/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MIDDAY_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What you can do

Once connected, you can ask your MCP client about your Midday data:

- "What was my revenue last month?"
- "Show unpaid invoices"
- "How much did I spend on software?"
- "What's my runway?"

The assistant queries your actual Midday data and returns accurate results.

## Available tools

The MCP integration provides tools for:

- **Transactions**: List, search, filter
- **Invoices**: View, list by status
- **Customers**: List and view details
- **Time tracking**: View projects and entries
- **Reports**: Revenue, expenses, runway

## Security

- API keys have read-only access by default
- Revoke keys anytime from Settings → Developer
- Each key shows last used date

## Tips

- Use specific questions for best results
- Include date ranges when relevant
- The MCP integration has the same capabilities as the in-app assistant
