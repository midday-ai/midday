The Midday assistant is available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), letting you query your financial data from AI tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, ChatGPT, and Raycast.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. Instead of copying and pasting data, MCP lets AI tools query your Midday data directly and securely.

## Supported tools

Midday MCP works with:

- **Claude Desktop** - Anthropic's desktop app
- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor
- **ChatGPT** - Via plugins/actions
- **Raycast** - Mac productivity launcher
- **Any MCP-compatible client**

## Getting started

### Step 1: Get your API key

1. Go to [Settings → Developer](https://app.midday.ai/settings/developer)
2. Click **Create API key**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Claude Desktop")
4. Copy the key immediately (you won't see it again)

### Step 2: Configure your client

Choose your tool below for specific setup instructions.

---

## Claude Desktop setup

Add Midday to your Claude Desktop configuration.

### Find your config file

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Add Midday configuration

Add or update the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "midday": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@midday-ai/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MIDDAY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Restart Claude Desktop

After saving, restart Claude Desktop. You should see Midday in your available tools.

### Test it

Ask Claude something like:
- "What was my revenue last month?"
- "Show me unpaid invoices"
- "What's my current runway?"

---

## Cursor setup

Use Midday data while coding in Cursor.

### Open Cursor settings

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
3. Find the MCP configuration section

### Add Midday

Add to your MCP servers:

```json
{
  "midday": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@midday-ai/mcp"],
    "env": {
      "MIDDAY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

### Use in conversations

In Cursor's AI chat, you can now ask about your financial data while working on your projects.

### Custom GPT approach

1. Create a Custom GPT in ChatGPT
2. Add actions that call the Midday API
3. Configure authentication with your API key

### Configuration

Use the Midday API endpoints with your API key in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

See the [API reference](/docs/api-reference) for available endpoints.

## Security

### API key permissions

- API keys have **read-only access** by default
- Cannot create, modify, or delete data
- Cannot access sensitive credentials or payment information

### Managing keys

1. Go to [Settings → Developer](https://app.midday.ai/settings/developer)
2. View all active API keys
3. See last used date for each key
4. Revoke keys you no longer need

### Best practices

- Create separate keys for different tools
- Use descriptive names for keys
- Revoke unused keys
- Don't share keys publicly

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Tool not found" errors

- Ensure you've restarted your client after configuration
- Check that the API key is valid
- Verify the configuration syntax

### No data returned

- Check your API key has access to the team
- Verify transactions/invoices exist for the queried period
- Try a broader query

### Connection issues

- Ensure you have internet access
- Check that `npx` is available in your PATH
- Try running `npx @midday-ai/mcp` manually to test

---

## Tips for best results

1. **Be specific**: "Revenue last month" works better than "How am I doing?"
2. **Include dates**: "Expenses in Q4 2024" helps narrow results
3. **Use follow-ups**: The assistant remembers context in a conversation
4. **Try different phrasings**: If one query doesn't work, rephrase it
