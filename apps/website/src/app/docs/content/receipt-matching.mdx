Midday's inbox captures receipts and invoices, then uses AI to match them to your bank transactions. No more manual filing or searching for receipts at tax time.

## How it works

1. A receipt arrives in your inbox (via email forward, connected email, or upload)
2. AI extracts the merchant, amount, and date
3. The system searches your transactions for matches
4. When confident, it attaches the receipt automatically
5. Uncertain matches are flagged for your review

## Matching intelligence

The AI uses multiple signals to find the right match:

- **Amount**: Receipt total vs transaction amount
- **Date**: Purchase date vs transaction clearing date (accounting for delays)
- **Merchant**: Company name on receipt vs bank description
- **Patterns**: Your past matching decisions

Even if the merchant name differs between receipt and bank statement, the AI recognizes patterns (e.g., "AMZN" matches "Amazon.com").

### Manual upload

Drag and drop files directly:

1. Go to [Inbox](https://app.midday.ai/inbox)
2. Click **Upload** or drag files into the window
3. PDFs and images are processed automatically

## Review matches

Some matches need your confirmation:

1. Go to [Inbox](https://app.midday.ai/inbox)
2. Items with suggested matches show a confidence indicator
3. Click to review the suggested transaction
4. Confirm or select a different transaction

The more you confirm, the smarter matching becomes.

## Unmatched items

If a receipt doesn't match any transaction:

- It might be for a transaction that hasn't cleared yet
- The transaction might be from a different account
- You can manually match it to any transaction

## Tips for reliable matching

- Forward receipts promptly (same day is best)
- Include the full receipt, not cropped photos
- Connect your bank to ensure transactions are available for matching
