Projects help you organize time tracking by client, engagement, or type of work.

## Create a project

1. Go to [Time Tracking](https://app.midday.ai/tracker)
2. Click **New project**
3. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: Something recognizable (e.g., "Acme Corp - Website Redesign")
   - **Client**: Optional; link to a customer
   - **Rate**: Hourly rate for billing
   - **Budget**: Optional estimate in hours
4. Click **Create**

## Project settings

### Billable vs. non-billable

Mark projects as billable or non-billable:

- **Billable**: Time can be invoiced at the project rate
- **Non-billable**: Internal work, not invoiced (e.g., admin, learning)

### Hourly rate

Set a rate for the project:

- Used when creating invoices from tracked time
- Can differ from your default rate
- Override per-entry if needed

### Budget / Estimate

Set an expected total hours:

- Track progress toward the estimate
- Get alerts when approaching the budget
- Helpful for fixed-price projects

## Link to a customer

Connecting a project to a customer:

- Streamlines invoicing (customer info pre-fills)
- Lets you see total time for a customer across projects
- Keeps things organized

## Edit a project

1. Go to [Time Tracking](https://app.midday.ai/tracker)
2. Find the project
3. Click **Edit** (or the settings icon)
4. Make changes
5. Save

## Archive or delete

When a project is complete:

- **Archive**: Hides from active list but keeps history
- **Delete**: Removes project and all time entries (careful!)

Archive is usually the better choice.

## Tips

- Use consistent naming: "Client - Project" works well
- Set realistic budgets based on past similar work
- Review projects monthly; archive completed ones
