Runway tells you how many months you can keep operating based on your current cash and spending rate.

## Why runway matters

For any business, knowing your runway helps you:

- Plan for slow periods
- Decide when to raise prices or cut costs
- Make confident investment decisions

A healthy runway is typically 6+ months.

## View your runway

1. Go to [Overview](https://app.midday.ai)
2. Find the Runway card

You'll see:

- **Current cash**: Total balance across connected accounts
- **Monthly burn rate**: Average monthly net outflow
- **Runway**: How many months of cash you have

## How it's calculated

**Runway = Current Cash ÷ Average Monthly Burn Rate**

Example:
- Cash on hand: $60,000
- Monthly burn: $10,000
- Runway: 6 months

## Burn rate

Burn rate is your average monthly net cash outflow:

- Expenses minus income
- Calculated over the past 3-6 months
- Smooths out one-time spikes

## Improving runway

To extend your runway:

- **Increase income**: Raise prices, find new clients, send overdue invoice reminders
- **Decrease expenses**: Cut subscriptions, negotiate contracts, delay non-essential purchases
- **Accelerate receivables**: Offer early payment discounts, follow up on overdue invoices

## Monitoring

Check runway monthly at minimum. If it drops below 3 months, take action.

Set up notifications to alert you when cash drops below certain thresholds.
