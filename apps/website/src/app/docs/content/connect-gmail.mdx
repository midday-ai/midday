Connect your Gmail account to automatically capture receipts and invoices from your email.

## How it works

Once connected, Midday:

1. Scans your inbox for receipts and invoices
2. Extracts them automatically
3. Matches them to your bank transactions

No manual forwarding required.

## Connect Gmail

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Connect Gmail**
3. Sign in to your Google account
4. Grant Midday permission to read emails

## What Midday accesses

Midday has **read-only** access to your Gmail:

- Scans for emails that look like receipts or invoices
- Extracts attachments (PDFs, images)
- Does not modify, delete, or send emails

We only process emails that match receipt/invoice patterns.

## Privacy

- We don't read your personal emails
- Extracted receipts are stored securely in your Midday account
- You can revoke access at any time
- See our [Privacy Policy](https://midday.ai/privacy) for details

## Troubleshooting

### Missing receipts

If some receipts aren't being captured:

- They might be in a format we don't recognize
- Try forwarding them manually to your inbox email
- Check that the email isn't in spam or trash

### Duplicate receipts

If you're seeing duplicates:

- This can happen if you forward manually and have auto-capture on
- Midday attempts to deduplicate, but some may slip through
- Delete duplicates from your inbox

## Disconnect Gmail

To stop automatic capture:

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Disconnect** next to Gmail

You can also revoke access from your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## Tips

- Keep both email forwarding and Gmail connected for maximum capture
- Review your inbox weekly to catch any unmatched items
- The AI matching improves as you confirm matches
