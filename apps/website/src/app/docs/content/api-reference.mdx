- Transactions
- Invoices
- Customers
- Time tracking projects and entries
- Financial reports
- Documents
- Bank accounts

## Authentication

The Midday API supports two authentication methods:

### API Keys (for your own data)

For accessing your own Midday data in scripts, automations, or personal tools.

1. Go to [Settings → Developer](https://app.midday.ai/settings/developer)
2. Click **Create API key**
3. Give it a descriptive name
4. Copy the key immediately (you won't see it again)

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

### OAuth 2.0 (for user-facing apps)

For building apps that access other users' Midday data with their permission.

1. Create an OAuth application in [Settings → Developer](https://app.midday.ai/settings/developer)
2. Implement the OAuth authorization flow
3. Exchange authorization codes for access tokens
4. Use access tokens in API requests
