Quick solutions to common issues you might encounter with Midday.

## Bank connection issues

### Bank not syncing

If your bank connection stops syncing:

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Check if the account shows a warning icon
3. Click **Reconnect** and re-authenticate with your bank
4. Wait a few minutes for transactions to sync

**Why this happens**: Banks require re-authentication periodically (often every 90 days) for security.

### Bank not found

If you can't find your bank when connecting:

1. Try searching by the full official name
2. Check if your bank has a separate business banking platform (search for that instead)
3. Some smaller banks may not be supported yet
4. Use [CSV import](/docs/import-transactions-csv) as an alternative

### Missing transactions

If recent transactions aren't appearing:

1. **Wait**: Transactions can take 1-3 days to appear after clearing your bank
2. **Check the date range**: Make sure you're viewing the correct period
3. **Sync manually**: Click **Sync** in your account settings to force a refresh
4. **Verify in your bank**: Confirm the transaction has actually cleared

### Duplicate transactions

If you see duplicate transactions:

1. Check if you connected the same account twice
2. Look for pending vs. cleared versions of the same transaction
3. You can hide duplicates by marking them as excluded

## Receipt matching issues

### Receipts not matching

If receipts aren't matching to transactions:

1. **Transaction hasn't cleared**: Wait for the bank transaction to appear
2. **Different account**: The purchase might be on a different connected account
3. **Amount mismatch**: Tips, taxes, or currency conversion can cause slight differences
4. **Manual match**: You can always match manually from the inbox

### Receipt not processing

If an uploaded receipt stays stuck:

1. Check the file format (PDF, JPG, PNG work best)
2. Ensure the image is clear and readable
3. Try re-uploading the receipt
4. Very long receipts may need to be split into pages

### Gmail/Outlook not capturing receipts

If connected email isn't finding receipts:

1. Check the connection is still active in [Inbox Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Receipts in spam/junk folders may not be captured
3. Some receipt formats may not be recognized automatically
4. Forward important receipts manually as a backup

## Invoice issues

### Customer not receiving invoice

If a customer says they didn't get your invoice:

1. Check the email address is correct in customer details
2. Ask them to check spam/junk folders
3. Resend the invoice from the invoice detail page
4. Share the invoice link directly as a backup

### Online payment not working

If customers can't pay online:

1. Verify Stripe is connected in [Invoice Settings](https://app.midday.ai/settings/invoice)
2. Check that online payments are enabled for that invoice
3. Have the customer try a different card or browser
4. Check your Stripe dashboard for any declined payment details

### Invoice showing wrong currency

To fix invoice currency:

1. Edit the invoice
2. Change the currency setting
3. Re-enter amounts if needed
4. Save and resend

Set a default currency per customer to avoid this in the future.

## Report issues

### Numbers seem wrong

If your reports show unexpected numbers:

1. **Check date range**: Make sure you're viewing the intended period
2. **Review categories**: Miscategorized transactions affect reports
3. **Check excluded transactions**: Some transactions might be excluded
4. **Multiple currencies**: Exchange rates affect converted amounts

### Burn rate is too high

If burn rate seems inflated:

1. Check for **credit card payments** categorized incorrectly (should be "Credit Card Payment" to be excluded)
2. Look for **internal transfers** between your accounts
3. Review large one-time expenses that might skew the average

### Runway showing zero

If runway shows zero or seems wrong:

1. Verify you have **cash accounts** connected (checking/savings)
2. Check that accounts are **enabled** in settings
3. Make sure transactions are **categorized** (uncategorized expenses don't count toward burn rate)

## Time tracking issues

### Timer not saving

If tracked time isn't saving:

1. Make sure you selected a **project** before starting
2. Check your internet connection
3. Don't close the browser tab while timer is running
4. Use the desktop app for more reliable tracking

### Can't delete time entry

If you can't delete a time entry:

1. Check if it's been **invoiced** (invoiced time can't be deleted)
2. You may need to remove it from the invoice first
3. Archived projects may have restrictions

## Account and billing

### Can't access account

If you can't sign in:

1. Try **resetting your password**
2. Check you're using the correct email
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try a different browser or incognito mode

### Subscription issues

For billing questions:

1. Go to [Settings → Billing](https://app.midday.ai/settings/billing)
2. View current plan and payment method
3. Update payment details if needed
4. Contact support for invoice or refund requests

## Performance issues

### App running slowly

If Midday feels slow:

1. **Clear browser cache**: Old cached data can cause issues
2. **Check internet**: Slow connection affects load times
3. **Try a different browser**: Chrome and Firefox work best
4. **Close other tabs**: Free up browser memory

### Data not loading

If pages aren't loading data:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Sign out and back in
4. Clear browser cache
