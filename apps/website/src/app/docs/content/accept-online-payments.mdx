Enable online payments to let your customers pay invoices instantly with a credit card. Powered by Stripe.

## How it works

When online payments are enabled:

1. Your customer receives the invoice
2. They click the **Pay** button
3. They enter their card details on a secure Stripe page
4. Payment is processed and the invoice is marked as paid

Funds are deposited to your connected bank account.

## Set up Stripe

1. Go to [Settings](https://app.midday.ai/settings)
2. Find the Invoice section
3. Click **Connect Stripe**
4. Sign in to your Stripe account (or create one)
5. Complete the connection

Once connected, all invoices will have a Pay button.

## What customers see

When a customer clicks Pay:

1. They see the invoice amount and your business name
2. They enter card details on Stripe's secure checkout
3. They receive a payment confirmation

The entire experience is hosted by Stripe—professional and secure.

## Fees

Stripe charges payment processing fees:

- Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (varies by country)
- Fees are deducted from the payment before deposit
- See [Stripe's pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing) for details

Midday doesn't charge additional fees for payment processing.

## View payments

Payments are tracked in Midday:

1. Go to [Invoices](https://app.midday.ai/invoices)
2. Paid invoices show a **Paid** status
3. Click an invoice to see payment details

For detailed payment history, log into your Stripe dashboard.

## Disconnect Stripe

To stop accepting online payments:

1. Go to [Settings](https://app.midday.ai/settings)
2. Find the Invoice section
3. Click **Disconnect Stripe**

Existing invoices will no longer have a Pay button.

## Tips

- Customers can still pay via bank transfer—online payments are an additional option
- Some customers prefer traditional payment; make sure your bank details are on the invoice
- Monitor your Stripe dashboard for disputes or failed payments
