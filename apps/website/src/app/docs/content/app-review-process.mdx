description: Get your OAuth app verified and listed in the Midday app directory.
section: developer
order: 5
---

Once your OAuth app is working, you can submit it for review. Verified apps display a trust badge and can be listed in the Midday app directory for users to discover.

## Why get verified?

### For users

- **Trust badge**: Verified apps show users that Midday has reviewed the app
- **Confidence**: Users know the app meets security and quality standards
- **Discoverability**: Listed apps are easier to find

### For developers

- **Increased adoption**: Users trust verified apps more
- **App directory listing**: Reach Midday's user base
- **Partnership opportunities**: Connect with the Midday team

## Verification levels

### Unverified (default)

All new OAuth apps start unverified:

- Apps work fully
- Users see a warning: "This app hasn't been verified by Midday yet"
- Not listed in the app directory

### Verified

After passing review:

- No warning displayed to users
- Listed in the app directory (optional)
- Trust badge on consent screen

## Submission requirements

Before submitting, ensure your app has:

### 1. Complete app information

Fill out all fields in your OAuth application settings:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Yes | Clear, recognizable app name |
| Description | Yes | Brief description (1-2 sentences) |
| Overview | Recommended | Detailed description with features |
| Developer name | Yes | Your name or company name |
| Website | Yes | Your app's homepage |
| Logo | Recommended | Square image, at least 256x256px |
| Screenshots | Recommended | Up to 4 screenshots showing your app |

### 2. Working integration

Your app must:

- Successfully complete the OAuth flow
- Handle tokens correctly (refresh, expiration)
- Use requested scopes appropriately
- Handle errors gracefully

### 3. Privacy policy

- Link to your privacy policy from your website
- Explain what data you collect and how it's used
- Describe data retention and deletion policies

### 4. Security requirements

- Use HTTPS for all endpoints
- Store tokens securely
- Implement PKCE for public clients
- Never log or expose access tokens

## Submitting for review

1. Go to [Settings → Developer](https://app.midday.ai/settings/developer)
2. Click on your OAuth application
3. Fill in all required fields
4. Add screenshots if you have them

### Step 2: Test thoroughly

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] Authorization flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Token refresh works correctly
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] All requested scopes are actually used
- [ ] App works with different Midday accounts

### Step 3: Submit for review

1. In your OAuth application settings, click **Submit for review**

3. You'll receive an email confirming submission

## Review process

### What we check

Our team reviews:

| Area | What we look for |
|------|------------------|
| **Security** | HTTPS, secure token handling, PKCE for public clients |
| **Functionality** | OAuth flow works, errors handled, scopes used appropriately |
| **User experience** | Clear app name, accurate description, working website |
| **Privacy** | Privacy policy exists, data handling is clear |
| **Quality** | App does what it claims, no misleading information |

### Timeline

- **Initial review**: 3-5 business days
- **If changes needed**: We'll email specific feedback
- **Re-review after changes**: 2-3 business days

### Possible outcomes

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Approved** | Your app is verified and can be listed |
| **Changes requested** | We'll explain what needs to be fixed |
| **Rejected** | Doesn't meet requirements (with explanation) |

## After approval

### Verification badge

Approved apps display verification status on the consent screen, removing the "not verified" warning.

### App directory listing

After approval, you can opt to list your app in the Midday app directory:

1. Go to your OAuth application settings
2. Enable **List in app directory**
3. Ensure your logo and screenshots are uploaded

### Maintaining verification

To keep your verified status:

- Keep your app functional
- Respond to user issues
- Update your app when APIs change
- Don't change scope usage without notification

## Guidelines

### Naming

- Use your app's real name
- Don't include "Midday" unless you have permission
- Avoid misleading names that imply official Midday features

### Description

- Accurately describe what your app does
- List key features
- Be clear about any costs or limitations

### Screenshots

- Show your app's actual UI
- Demonstrate key features
- Use high-quality images
- Don't use misleading mockups

### Scopes

- Only request scopes you actually use
- Explain to users why you need each scope
- Don't request broad scopes for simple features

## Common rejection reasons

| Issue | How to fix |
|-------|------------|
| Missing privacy policy | Add one to your website |
| Non-working OAuth flow | Test thoroughly before submitting |
| Unused scopes | Remove scopes you don't use |
| Incomplete app info | Fill in all required fields |
| HTTP endpoints | Use HTTPS everywhere |
| Misleading description | Accurately describe your app |
| No error handling | Handle authorization denials gracefully |

## Updating verified apps

After verification, you can still update your app:

### No re-review needed

- Updating logo or screenshots
- Changing website URL
- Editing description
- Adding redirect URIs

### May trigger re-review

- Adding new scopes (users must re-authorize anyway)
- Significant functionality changes
- Changing app name
