## Managing integrations

3. Check connection status

### Disconnect an app

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Find the integration
3. Click **Disconnect**

Disconnecting removes the connection but doesn't delete historical data.

3. Click **Reconnect** and re-authorize

## Data and privacy

- **Read-only where possible**: Email integrations only read—never send
- **Minimal permissions**: We request only what's needed
- **Secure connections**: All integrations use OAuth or encrypted credentials
- **You control access**: Disconnect anytime
