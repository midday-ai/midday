Burn rate shows how quickly you're consuming cash. It's essential for financial planning, fundraising conversations, and understanding your business health.

## What is burn rate

Burn rate is your net cash outflow over a period:

- **Gross burn**: Total money going out
- **Net burn**: Money out minus money in

Net burn is more useful—it accounts for revenue offsetting expenses.

## View your burn rate

1. Go to [Overview](https://app.midday.ai)
2. Find the burn rate card

You'll see:

- Average monthly burn
- Trend over recent months
- How it affects your runway

## How burn rate is calculated

Midday calculates burn rate from your expense transactions across all enabled accounts.

### What's included

All expense transactions except those in excluded categories.

### What's excluded

Two categories are automatically excluded from burn rate to prevent double-counting:

| Category | Why it's excluded |
|----------|-------------------|
| Credit Card Payment | Prevents counting expenses twice (once on the card, once when paying the bill) |
| Internal Transfer | Moving money between your own accounts isn't spending |

### The double-counting problem

When you connect both a checking account and credit card, you'll see:

1. **On your credit card**: Individual purchases ($50 for software, $30 for meals, etc.)
2. **On your checking account**: Payment to credit card ($1,500)

Without exclusions, Midday would count:
- $50 + $30 + ... = expenses on credit card
- $1,500 = payment from checking
- Total = double the actual spending

By excluding credit card payments, only the actual purchases count. This is handled automatically.

### Which accounts affect burn rate

| Account Type | Transactions count toward burn? |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Depository (checking, savings) | Yes |
| Other Asset (money market) | Yes |
| Credit (credit cards) | Yes |
| Loan | Yes |

All account types contribute transactions to burn rate. The exclusion logic applies to specific transaction categories, not account types.

## Understanding the numbers

### Positive burn rate

You're spending more than you're earning. Normal for:

- Early-stage startups investing in growth
- Seasonal slow periods
- Planned investment phases (hiring, expansion)

### Negative burn rate

You're earning more than spending. You're profitable—your runway is essentially infinite.

### Zero burn rate

Breaking even. Income matches expenses.

## Excluding specific transactions

Sometimes a transaction shouldn't count toward burn rate even if it's categorized as an expense:

- One-time equipment purchases
- Security deposits (you'll get them back)
- Loans to the company from founders

To exclude a transaction:

1. Click on the transaction
2. Find the exclude option
3. The transaction will no longer affect burn rate

Use this sparingly—only for truly exceptional items.

## Trends matter

A single month's burn rate can be misleading due to one-time expenses or income. Look at:

- **3-month average**: Recent trend, shows if things are changing
- **6-month average**: Overall pattern, smooths out anomalies
- **Year-over-year**: For seasonal businesses, compare to the same period last year

## Burn rate and runway

Burn rate directly affects your runway:

```
Runway = Cash Balance ÷ Monthly Burn Rate
```

Reducing burn rate by $5,000/month on $60,000 cash extends runway from 6 months to 10 months.

## Reducing burn rate

If burn rate is too high:

- **Review subscriptions**: Audit software and services you're paying for
- **Negotiate contracts**: Vendors often offer discounts for annual payment or loyalty
- **Delay non-essential purchases**: Push discretionary spending to later
- **Focus on efficiency**: Higher-margin work or automation can help

## Common burn rate issues

### Burn rate seems too high

Check for:
- Credit card payments not categorized correctly (should be "Credit Card Payment")
- Internal transfers between accounts not categorized correctly
- One-time expenses skewing the average

### Burn rate seems too low

Check for:
- Missing accounts (expenses on unconnected accounts)
- Transactions incorrectly categorized as transfers
- Disabled accounts that should be enabled

### Burn rate is zero or missing

This usually means:
- No expense transactions in the selected period
- All accounts are disabled
- Transactions aren't categorized yet

## Tips

- Review burn rate monthly—catch issues early
- Compare to revenue: high burn with high revenue growth might be the right strategy
- Plan for spikes: quarterly taxes, annual renewals, seasonal hiring
- Share with your team: financial visibility helps everyone make better decisions
