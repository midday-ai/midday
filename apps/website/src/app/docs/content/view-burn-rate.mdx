Burn rate shows how quickly you're consuming cash. It's essential for financial planning and understanding your business health.

## What is burn rate

Burn rate is your net cash outflow over a period:

- **Gross burn**: Total money going out
- **Net burn**: Money out minus money in

Net burn is more useful—it accounts for revenue offsetting expenses.

## View your burn rate

1. Go to [Overview](https://app.midday.ai)
2. Find the burn rate information

You'll see:

- Average monthly burn
- Trend over recent months
- How it affects your runway

## Understanding the numbers

### Positive burn rate

You're spending more than you're earning. Normal for:

- Early-stage businesses
- Seasonal slow periods
- Planned investment phases

### Negative burn rate

You're earning more than spending. You're profitable.

### Zero burn rate

Breaking even. Income matches expenses.

## Trends matter

A single month's burn rate can be misleading due to one-time expenses or income. Look at:

- 3-month average for recent trend
- 6-month average for overall pattern
- Year-over-year comparison for seasonal businesses

## Reducing burn rate

If burn rate is too high:

- Review recurring subscriptions
- Negotiate vendor contracts
- Delay non-essential purchases
- Focus on higher-margin work

## Tips

- Review monthly
- Compare to revenue—high burn with high revenue might be okay
- Plan for spikes (quarterly taxes, annual renewals)
