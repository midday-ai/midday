Midday supports e-invoicing through the [Peppol network](https://peppol.org/), a global standard for electronic document exchange used by businesses and governments in over 30 countries. When you send an invoice, Midday automatically converts it to the compliant UBL format, validates it against tax rules, and delivers it through the Peppol network.

## How it works

1. **Complete your company details** — Add your business address, VAT number, and country in Settings > Company
2. **Register for e-invoicing** — One-time Peppol registration with identity verification (up to 72 hours)
3. **Send invoices as usual** — When your customer has a Peppol ID, the invoice is automatically delivered via the Peppol network in addition to email

Behind the scenes, Midday handles:

- Converting your invoice to [GOBL](https://gobl.org/) (Go Business Language) format
- Validating all fields against the relevant tax regime
- Generating a Peppol BIS Billing UBL 3.0 compliant document
- Delivering through the Peppol network to your customer's Access Point

## What you need

To start sending e-invoices, you need:

- **Company address** — Full postal address
- **VAT number** — Your tax identification number
- **Country** — Where your business is registered
- **Peppol registration** — One-time setup with identity verification

Your customers need:

- **Peppol ID** — Their Peppol participant identifier (usually derived from their VAT number)
- **Address and VAT** — For the invoice to pass validation

See the [Setup Guide](/docs/e-invoicing-setup) for step-by-step instructions.

## Country-specific compliance (planned)

Some countries have their own e-invoicing systems in addition to or instead of Peppol. We're working on adding support for:

- **Spain** — VERI\*FACTU (mandatory from 2027)
- **Italy** — SDI for domestic B2B
- **Portugal** — AT certified invoicing
- **France** — Chorus Pro for B2G, Factur-X for B2B
- **Mexico** — CFDI via SAT
- **Colombia** — DIAN electronic invoicing
- **Greece** — myDATA reporting

These will be added as separate integrations. Peppol already covers cross-border invoicing for all of these countries.
