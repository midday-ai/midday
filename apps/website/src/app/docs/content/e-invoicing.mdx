E-invoicing lets you send invoices electronically through the Peppol network—a secure, standardized way to exchange business documents across Europe and beyond.

## What is Peppol?

Peppol (Pan-European Public Procurement Online) is a network that enables businesses to send and receive electronic invoices in a standardized format. It's:

- **Required** for invoicing government entities in many EU countries
- **Preferred** by large enterprises for B2B transactions
- **Compliant** with EU e-invoicing regulations (Directive 2014/55/EU)

When you send an invoice via Peppol, it goes directly to your customer's accounting system—no email attachments, no manual data entry.

## Supported countries

Peppol is available in **46 countries and territories** worldwide.

## When to use e-invoicing

Use Peppol e-invoicing when:

- Invoicing government or public sector organizations
- Your customer requires or prefers electronic invoices
- You want to meet EU e-invoicing compliance requirements
- You're doing business in countries with e-invoicing mandates

## Enable e-invoicing

E-invoicing is controlled per invoice template:

1. Go to [Invoices](https://app.midday.ai/invoices)
2. Open the invoice settings (gear icon)
3. Enable **E-Invoice (Peppol)**
4. Optionally enable **E-Invoice notification** to send an email when delivered

When enabled, invoices will be sent via Peppol if the customer has a Peppol ID configured.

## Set up customer Peppol ID

For e-invoicing to work, your customer needs a Peppol ID:

1. Go to [Customers](https://app.midday.ai/customers)
2. Select or create a customer
3. Add their **Peppol ID** in the customer details

### Peppol ID format

A Peppol ID consists of a scheme and identifier, separated by a colon:

```
{scheme}:{identifier}
```

Examples:

| Country | Scheme | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Norway | 0192 | 0192:123456789 |
| Sweden | 0007 | 0007:5561234567 |
| Germany | 9930 | 9930:DE123456789 |
| Global (GLN) | 0088 | 0088:1234567890123 |

Ask your customer for their Peppol ID—they'll know it if they receive e-invoices.

## Company settings

For compliant e-invoices, configure your company details:

1. Go to [Settings > Company](https://app.midday.ai/settings/company)
2. Fill in your company address
3. Add your Tax ID / VAT number
4. Optionally add your own Peppol ID

These details appear on your e-invoices as required by regulations.

## What happens when you send

When you send an invoice to a customer with a Peppol ID:

1. The invoice is converted to Peppol UBL format
2. It's delivered through the Peppol network
3. Your customer receives it in their e-invoicing system
4. The invoice is marked as sent in Midday

If e-invoicing fails after multiple attempts, the invoice is automatically sent via email with PDF attachment.

## Email notifications

When **E-Invoice notification** is enabled, customers receive a brief email letting them know an e-invoice was delivered to their Peppol inbox. This is optional—the e-invoice itself is delivered through Peppol, not email.

## Troubleshooting

### Invoice sent via email instead of Peppol

Check that:

- E-invoicing is enabled on the invoice template
- The customer has a valid Peppol ID
- The Peppol ID format is correct (scheme:identifier)

### Customer not receiving e-invoices

Verify the Peppol ID with your customer. They should confirm:

- The ID is active and registered
- Their system is configured to receive invoices

### Invalid Peppol ID error

The Peppol ID format may be incorrect. Common issues:

- Missing colon separator
- Wrong scheme code for the country
- Identifier doesn't match scheme requirements (e.g., GLN must be 13 digits)
