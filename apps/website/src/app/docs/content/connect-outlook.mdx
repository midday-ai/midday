Connect your Outlook account to automatically capture receipts and invoices from your email. Works with Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, and work/school accounts.

## How it works

Once connected, Midday:

1. Scans your Outlook inbox for emails that look like receipts and invoices
2. Uses AI to identify transaction-related emails
3. Extracts attachments and relevant data
4. Sends them to your Midday inbox for matching

The scanning happens automatically on a regular schedule.

## Connect Outlook

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Connect Outlook**
3. Sign in to your Microsoft account
4. Review the permissions and click **Accept**

### Supported account types

- **Outlook.com**: Personal Microsoft accounts
- **Microsoft 365**: Business and enterprise accounts
- **Work/School**: Organizational accounts (if permitted by your IT admin)

## What emails are scanned

### Emails we process

The AI looks for emails that are likely receipts or invoices:

- **Order confirmations**: E-commerce purchases, online orders
- **Digital receipts**: Uber, travel bookings, services
- **Subscription receipts**: SaaS tools, subscriptions, memberships
- **Invoice emails**: Bills, vendor invoices, payment confirmations
- **Bank notifications**: Transaction alerts with receipt information

### Emails we ignore

The AI filters out non-receipt emails:

- **Marketing emails**: Newsletters, promotions, announcements
- **Social notifications**: LinkedIn, Teams messages
- **Personal emails**: Non-business correspondence
- **Spam/Junk**: Anything in your junk folder
- **General business emails**: Meeting invites, project discussions

### Focused Inbox consideration

If you use Outlook's Focused Inbox feature, receipts may land in either Focused or Other. Midday scans both.

## What Midday accesses

Midday has **read-only** access to your Outlook:

| Permission | What it allows | What we do |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Read mail | View email content | Scan for receipt-like patterns |
| Read attachments | View email attachments | Extract PDFs and images |

### What we cannot do

- Send emails from your account
- Delete or modify emails
- Access contacts or calendar
- Read OneDrive files

## Privacy and security

### Data handling

- **Selective processing**: Only emails matching receipt patterns are processed
- **Secure storage**: Extracted receipts are encrypted in your Midday account
- **No training data**: Your emails are not used to train AI models
- **Team isolation**: Only your team can access your receipts

### What we store

- Extracted receipt/invoice files (PDFs, images)
- Extracted data (merchant, amount, date)
- Email metadata for deduplication (subject line, date, sender)

We don't store the full content of non-receipt emails.

### Enterprise considerations

For Microsoft 365 and work accounts:

- Your organization's policies may affect what apps can connect
- Check with your IT admin if you have connection issues
- Admin consent may be required for organizational accounts

## Scan settings

### Scan frequency

Midday scans your inbox periodically. You can trigger a manual scan:

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Sync now** next to Outlook

### Historical receipts

When first connected, Midday looks back at recent emails (typically 30-90 days) to capture existing receipts.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing receipts

If some receipts aren't being captured:

- **Check junk folder**: We don't scan junk mail
- **Check Other inbox**: If using Focused Inbox, check both views
- **Manual forward**: Forward specific receipts to your inbox email address
- **Wait for sync**: New emails may take a few minutes to process

### Permission issues

If connection fails:

- **Wrong account**: Ensure you're signing in with the correct Microsoft account
- **Organization policy**: Your IT admin may need to allow third-party apps
- **Admin consent**: Work accounts may require admin approval

Contact your IT admin if using a work account and experiencing issues.

### Connection expired

Microsoft may require periodic re-authorization:

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Reconnect** next to Outlook
3. Sign in again to reauthorize

## Disconnect Outlook

To stop automatic capture:

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Disconnect** next to Outlook

### Revoke from Microsoft

You can also revoke access from your [Microsoft Account settings](https://account.live.com/consent/Manage):

1. Find "Midday" in your connected applications
2. Click **Remove permissions**

For work/school accounts, use the [Microsoft 365 app permissions page](https://myapps.microsoft.com/).

Receipts already in your Midday inbox remain; no new receipts will sync.

## Tips

- **Works great with forwarding**: Use both for comprehensive capture
- **Review weekly**: Check your Midday inbox for unmatched items
- **Confirm matches**: The AI learns from your confirmations
- **Use blocklist**: Block unwanted senders in inbox settings
