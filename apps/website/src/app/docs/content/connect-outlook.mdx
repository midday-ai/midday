Connect your Outlook account to automatically capture receipts and invoices from your email.

## How it works

Once connected, Midday:

1. Scans your Outlook inbox for receipts and invoices
2. Extracts them automatically
3. Matches them to your bank transactions

No manual forwarding required.

## Connect Outlook

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Connect Outlook**
3. Sign in to your Microsoft account
4. Grant Midday permission to read emails

Works with Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, and work/school accounts.

## What Midday accesses

Midday has **read-only** access to your Outlook:

- Scans for emails that look like receipts or invoices
- Extracts attachments (PDFs, images)
- Does not modify, delete, or send emails

We only process emails that match receipt/invoice patterns.

## Privacy

- We don't read your personal emails
- Extracted receipts are stored securely in your Midday account
- You can revoke access at any time
- See our [Privacy Policy](https://midday.ai/privacy) for details

## Troubleshooting

### Missing receipts

If some receipts aren't being captured:

- They might be in a format we don't recognize
- Try forwarding them manually to your inbox email
- Check focused inbox vs. other inbox

### Permission issues

If connection fails:

- Ensure you're signing in with the correct Microsoft account
- Check that your organization allows third-party app connections
- Contact your IT admin if using a work account

## Disconnect Outlook

To stop automatic capture:

1. Go to [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings)
2. Click **Disconnect** next to Outlook

You can also revoke access from your [Microsoft Account settings](https://account.live.com/consent/Manage).

## Tips

- Works great alongside email forwarding for maximum coverage
- Review your inbox weekly to confirm matches
- The AI learns from your confirmations
