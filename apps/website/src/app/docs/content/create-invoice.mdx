Midday makes it easy to create professional invoices that look great and help you get paid faster.

## Create a new invoice

1. Go to [Invoices](https://app.midday.ai/invoices)
2. Click **Create invoice**
3. Fill in the details (see below)
4. Choose **Send** to email immediately, or **Save as draft**

## Invoice details

### Customer

Select an existing customer or create a new one. You'll need:

- Customer name
- Email address (for sending)
- Optional: Address, VAT number, contact person

### Line items

Add what you're billing for:

- **Description**: What the item or service is
- **Quantity**: Number of units
- **Price**: Unit price
- **Tax**: Optional tax rate

Add as many line items as needed. The total calculates automatically.

### Invoice settings

- **Invoice number**: Auto-generated, but you can customize
- **Issue date**: When the invoice is created
- **Due date**: When payment is expected
- **Currency**: Defaults to your base currency, can change per invoice
- **Notes**: Optional message to your customer

## Sending options

### Send by email

Select **Create & Send** as your delivery method to email the invoice directly to your customer. They receive a professional email that includes:

- Your logo and company name
- The invoice amount, due date, and invoice number
- A button to view the full invoice online
- A PDF attachment (if enabled)
- A link to pay online (if Stripe is connected)

#### Preview the email before sending

When **Create & Send** is selected, an email icon appears in the toolbar. Click it to open a preview of the exact email your customer will receive. You can customize the subject line, heading, body text, and button label directly from the preview — just click on any text to edit. Changes are saved to your template automatically.
