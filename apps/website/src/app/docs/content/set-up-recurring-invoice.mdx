Recurring invoices save time for ongoing client relationships. Set it once, and Midday sends invoices automatically.

## When to use recurring invoices

- Monthly retainer clients
- Subscription services you provide
- Regular consulting arrangements
- Any predictable, repeating billing

## Create a recurring invoice

1. Go to [Invoices](https://app.midday.ai/invoices) → **Create invoice**
2. Fill in customer and line items as usual
3. Enable **Recurring**
4. Set the schedule:
   - **Frequency**: Weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly
   - **Start date**: When the first invoice should send
   - **End date**: Optional; leave blank for indefinite
5. Review and confirm

The first invoice is created immediately or on the start date.

## What happens automatically

On each scheduled date:

1. A new invoice is generated with updated dates
2. Invoice number increments automatically
3. The invoice is sent to your customer
4. You receive a confirmation

## Managing recurring invoices

View all recurring invoices:

1. Go to [Invoices](https://app.midday.ai/invoices)
2. Filter by **Recurring**

### Edit the schedule

1. Open a recurring invoice
2. Click **Edit recurring**
3. Change frequency, amount, or line items
4. Save

Changes apply to future invoices only.

### Pause or stop

To stop a recurring invoice:

2. Click **Edit recurring**
3. Set an end date or disable recurring
4. Save

Past invoices are not affected.

## Tips

- Update for price changes at contract renewal time
- Use clear descriptions so customers know what they're paying for
