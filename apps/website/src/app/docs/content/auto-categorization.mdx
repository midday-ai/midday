Every transaction that flows into Midday is automatically categorized using AI. This saves hours of manual work and keeps your books organized.

## How it works

When a new transaction arrives, Midday's AI:

1. Analyzes the merchant name and description
2. Looks at your past categorization choices
3. Considers the transaction amount and patterns
4. Assigns the most likely category

The AI learns from your corrections. The more you use Midday, the more accurate it becomes for your specific business.

## Categories

Midday uses standard accounting categories that work for most small businesses:

**Income categories:**
- Revenue
- Other income

**Expense categories:**
- Software & subscriptions
- Travel & transportation
- Office supplies
- Meals & entertainment
- Professional services
- Marketing & advertising
- Rent & utilities
- Equipment
- And more...

## Changing a category

If the AI gets it wrong:

1. Click on the transaction
2. Select the correct category from the dropdown
3. Save

The AI remembers this for future similar transactions.

## Bulk categorization

For multiple similar transactions:

1. Use filters to find the transactions
2. Select multiple transactions
3. Choose **Categorize** from the bulk actions
4. Apply the category to all selected

## Tips for better categorization

- **Correct mistakes promptly**: The AI learns from corrections
- **Be consistent**: Use the same category for similar expenses
- **Use tags for extra detail**: Categories are broad; tags add specificity

## Categories and accounting

When you [export to your accountant](/docs/export-transactions-csv), categories map to standard chart of accounts entries. If you use Xero, QuickBooks, or Fortnox, categories sync automatically.
