This guide walks you through setting up e-invoicing in Midday. The process takes about 5 minutes of your time, plus up to 72 hours for Peppol verification.

## Step 1: Complete company details

Your business information is required for e-invoicing compliance. Go to **Settings > Company** and fill in:

- **Company name** — Your legal business name
- **Company address** — Full postal address (street, city, postal code, country)
- **VAT number** — Your tax identification number (e.g. BE0316597904 for Belgium)
- **Email** — Business contact email

> You can also provide these details when creating a team. The address field supports Google Places autocomplete to make it faster.

## Step 2: Register for e-invoicing

Once your company details are complete, scroll down to the **E-Invoicing** section on the Company settings page and click **Register for e-invoicing**.

This starts the Peppol registration process:

1. Your company details are submitted for verification
2. You may receive a link to complete a proof of ownership form
3. Your identity is verified (this can take up to 72 hours)
4. Once approved, your Peppol participant ID is assigned automatically

You can check the registration status at any time in Settings > Company. The status will show:

- **Pending** — Registration submitted, waiting for processing
- **Processing** — Verification in progress
- **Registered** — You're ready to send e-invoices
- **Error** — Something went wrong (details shown, you can retry)

## Step 3: Add customer Peppol IDs

To send an e-invoice to a customer, they need a Peppol participant ID. You can add this when creating or editing a customer:

1. Go to **Customers** and select or create a customer
2. Open the **Details** section
3. Enter their **Peppol ID** (usually in the format `0208:VATNUMBER` for Belgium, `9930:VATNUMBER` for Germany, etc.)

> If you don't know your customer's Peppol ID, ask them for it or look them up in the [Peppol Directory](https://directory.peppol.eu/).

## Step 4: Send an invoice

That's it. Create and send an invoice as you normally would. When:

- Your team is registered for Peppol, AND
- The customer has a Peppol ID, AND
- Your company data is complete (address + VAT)

...the invoice will automatically be converted to UBL format, validated, and delivered through the Peppol network in addition to the regular email delivery.

You can see the e-invoice status on each invoice — it will show whether the Peppol submission succeeded or if there were any issues.

## Existing Peppol ID

If your business is already registered on the Peppol network through another provider, you can enter your existing Peppol participant ID in Settings > Company. This ID will be reused during the Midday registration process instead of generating a new one.

## Troubleshooting

### Registration is taking longer than expected

Peppol registration includes identity verification which can take up to 72 hours. If it's been longer than that and the status still shows "Processing", please contact support.

### Invoice submission failed

Common reasons for e-invoice failures:

- **Invalid VAT number** — Check that both your company and customer VAT numbers are correct and properly formatted
- **Missing customer address** — The customer needs a complete address for Peppol compliance
- **Missing Peppol ID** — The customer must have a Peppol participant ID

Error details are shown on the invoice and in the e-invoice status section of the invoice settings.

### Customer doesn't have a Peppol ID

Not all businesses are on the Peppol network yet. If your customer isn't registered:

- The invoice will still be sent via email as usual
- E-invoicing will be skipped for that customer
- You can ask them to register with their own Peppol provider, or they may need to do so when their country mandates it
