Connect Midday to Xero to export your categorized transactions to your accounting software.

## How it works

Once connected:

1. Transactions arrive from your bank and receipts are matched automatically
2. Ready transactions appear in the **Review** tab (the export queue)
3. Export to Xero — categories map to your chart of accounts
4. Exported transactions are marked as **Exported** in Midday

## Connect Xero

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Find **Xero**
3. Click **Connect**
4. Sign in to your Xero account
5. Authorize Midday to access your organization

## Category mapping

Midday categories map to Xero accounts:

- Match each Midday category to the appropriate Xero account code
- Mapping is configured once during setup
- You can update mappings in settings

Work with your accountant to ensure the mappings match your chart of accounts.

## What gets exported

- Transaction date
- Amount
- Description/merchant name
- Category (mapped to Xero account)
- Attached receipts (as files)

## Exporting transactions

1. Go to the **Review** tab in [Transactions](https://app.midday.ai/transactions)
2. Select the transactions you want to export (or export all)
3. Click **Export** and choose **Xero**
4. Transactions and receipts are sent to Xero with your category mappings applied
5. Exported transactions are marked as **Exported** in Midday

## Disconnect

To remove the connection:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Disconnect** on Xero

Previously exported data remains in Xero.

## Tips

- Work with your accountant to set up correct category mappings
- Review the first few exported transactions in Xero to verify accuracy
- Keep receipts attached in Midday—they export with transactions
- Export regularly (weekly or monthly) to keep Xero current
