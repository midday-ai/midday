Connect Midday to Xero to export your categorized transactions to your accounting software.

## How it works

Once connected:

1. Categorize transactions in Midday
2. Export to Xero when you're ready
3. Categories map to your Xero chart of accounts
4. Your accountant sees clean, pre-categorized data

No more manual data entry or messy CSV imports.

## Connect Xero

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Find **Xero**
3. Click **Connect**
4. Sign in to your Xero account
5. Authorize Midday to access your organization

## Category mapping

Midday categories map to Xero accounts:

- Match each Midday category to the appropriate Xero account code
- Mapping is configured once during setup
- You can update mappings in settings

Work with your accountant to ensure the mappings match your chart of accounts.

## What gets exported

- Transaction date
- Amount
- Description/merchant name
- Category (mapped to Xero account)
- Attached receipts (as files)

## Exporting transactions

Export your transactions when you're ready:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Export** on your Xero connection
3. Select the date range to export
4. Review and confirm

Exported transactions appear in Xero with your category mappings applied.

## Disconnect

To remove the connection:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Disconnect** on Xero

Previously exported data remains in Xero.

## Tips

- Work with your accountant to set up correct category mappings
- Review the first few exported transactions in Xero to verify accuracy
- Keep receipts attached in Midday—they export with transactions
- Export regularly (weekly or monthly) to keep Xero current
