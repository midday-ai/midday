Connect Midday to Xero to automatically sync your categorized transactions to your accounting software.

## How it works

Once connected:

1. Transactions in Midday sync to Xero automatically
2. Categories map to your Xero chart of accounts
3. Your accountant sees clean, pre-categorized data

No more manual data entry or CSV imports.

## Connect Xero

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Find **Xero**
3. Click **Connect**
4. Sign in to your Xero account
5. Authorize Midday to access your organization

## Category mapping

Midday categories map to Xero accounts:

- Match each Midday category to the appropriate Xero account code
- Mapping is configured once during setup
- You can update mappings in settings

## What syncs

- Transaction date
- Amount
- Description
- Category (mapped to Xero account)
- Attached receipts (as files)

## Sync frequency

Transactions sync automatically:

- New transactions are pushed when they're categorized
- You can also trigger a manual sync

## Disconnect

To stop syncing:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Disconnect** on Xero

Past synced data remains in Xero.

## Tips

- Work with your accountant to set up the correct category mappings
- Review the first few synced transactions in Xero to verify accuracy
- Keep receipts attached in Midday—they sync too
