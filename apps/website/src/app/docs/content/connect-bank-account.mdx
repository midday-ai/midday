Connecting your bank is the foundation of Midday. Once linked, your transactions sync automatically, giving you a complete picture of your business finances.

## How it works

Midday uses secure, read-only connections to sync your transactions. We partner with leading banking providers to support over 20,000 banks worldwide.

- **Read-only access**: We can only view transactions, never move money
- **Bank-level security**: Connections use OAuth or secure credential encryption
- **Automatic sync**: New transactions appear within minutes

## Connect your bank

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Click **Connect bank**
3. Search for your bank by name
4. Select your bank and follow the authentication flow
5. Choose which accounts to connect

Most banks use secure OAuth, which means you authenticate directly with your bank—Midday never sees your login credentials.

## What gets synced

Once connected, Midday pulls:

- **Transaction history**: Usually 90 days of past transactions
- **Account balance**: Updated with each sync
- **Transaction details**: Date, amount, merchant name, category

New transactions typically appear within a few minutes of clearing your bank.

## Multiple accounts and currencies

You can connect multiple bank accounts, even from different banks:

- Business checking and savings accounts
- Credit card accounts
- Accounts in different currencies

Each account syncs independently. Multi-currency transactions are converted using the exchange rate from the transaction date.

## Troubleshooting

### Bank not found

If you can't find your bank:

1. Try searching by the full official name
2. Check if your bank has a separate business banking platform
3. Use [manual import via CSV](/docs/import-transactions-csv) as a fallback

### Connection issues

If your bank connection stops syncing:

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Click **Reconnect** on the affected account
3. Re-authenticate with your bank

Some banks require re-authentication every 90 days for security.

### Missing transactions

If transactions are missing:

1. Allow a few minutes for sync to complete
2. Check your bank's online portal to confirm the transaction has cleared
3. Try clicking **Sync** to force an immediate refresh
