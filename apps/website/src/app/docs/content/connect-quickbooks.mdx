Connect Midday to QuickBooks Online to automatically sync your categorized transactions to your accounting software.

## How it works

Once connected:

1. Transactions in Midday sync to QuickBooks automatically
2. Categories map to your QuickBooks chart of accounts
3. Your accountant sees clean, pre-categorized data

No more manual data entry or CSV imports.

## Connect QuickBooks

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Find **QuickBooks**
3. Click **Connect**
4. Sign in to your QuickBooks account
5. Select your QuickBooks company
6. Authorize Midday

## Category mapping

Midday categories map to QuickBooks accounts:

- Match each Midday category to the appropriate QuickBooks account
- Mapping is configured once during setup
- You can update mappings in settings

## What syncs

- Transaction date
- Amount
- Description
- Category (mapped to QuickBooks account)
- Attached receipts (as files)

## Sync frequency

Transactions sync automatically:

- New transactions are pushed when they're categorized
- You can also trigger a manual sync

## Disconnect

To stop syncing:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Disconnect** on QuickBooks

Past synced data remains in QuickBooks.

## Tips

- Work with your accountant to set up the correct category mappings
- Review the first few synced transactions in QuickBooks to verify accuracy
- Keep receipts attached in Midday—they sync too
