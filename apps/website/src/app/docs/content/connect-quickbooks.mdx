Connect Midday to QuickBooks Online to export your categorized transactions to your accounting software.

## How it works

Once connected:

1. Categorize transactions in Midday
2. Export to QuickBooks when you're ready
3. Categories map to your QuickBooks chart of accounts
4. Your accountant sees clean, pre-categorized data

No more manual data entry or messy CSV imports.

## Connect QuickBooks

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Find **QuickBooks**
3. Click **Connect**
4. Sign in to your QuickBooks account
5. Select your QuickBooks company
6. Authorize Midday

## Category mapping

Midday categories map to QuickBooks accounts:

- Match each Midday category to the appropriate QuickBooks account
- Mapping is configured once during setup
- You can update mappings in settings

Work with your accountant to ensure the mappings match your chart of accounts.

## What gets exported

- Transaction date
- Amount
- Description/merchant name
- Category (mapped to QuickBooks account)
- Attached receipts (as files)

## Exporting transactions

Export your transactions when you're ready:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Export** on your QuickBooks connection
3. Select the date range to export
4. Review and confirm

Exported transactions appear in QuickBooks with your category mappings applied.

## Disconnect

To remove the connection:

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.midday.ai/apps)
2. Click **Disconnect** on QuickBooks

Previously exported data remains in QuickBooks.

## Tips

- Work with your accountant to set up correct category mappings
- Review the first few exported transactions in QuickBooks to verify accuracy
- Keep receipts attached in Midday—they export with transactions
- Export regularly (weekly or monthly) to keep QuickBooks current
