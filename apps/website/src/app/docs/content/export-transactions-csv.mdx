Export your transactions to CSV for your accountant, tax preparation, or your own analysis.

## Export transactions

1. Go to [Transactions](https://app.midday.ai/transactions)
2. Use filters to select the transactions you want (date range, category, etc.)
3. Click **Export**
4. Choose **CSV** format
5. Download the file

## What's included

The export includes:

- Date
- Description/Merchant
- Amount
- Category
- Account (which bank account)
- Tags (if any)
- Attached receipts (as links or filenames)
- Notes

## Preparing for export

Before exporting, make sure your transactions are:

- **Categorized**: The AI does this automatically, but review for accuracy
- **Matched with receipts**: Attach any missing receipts
- **Tagged**: Add any tags you want included in the export

## Export for your accountant

Accountants typically need:

- All transactions for a date range (month, quarter, or year)
- Proper categorization
- Receipt documentation

Set up a monthly or quarterly export routine:

1. Filter transactions for the period
2. Review categories and receipts
3. Export to CSV
4. Send to your accountant

## Tips

- Export after reconciling receipts for the period
- Keep a copy for your own records
- If your accountant uses Xero, QuickBooks, or Fortnox, consider [direct integration](/docs/connect-xero) instead
