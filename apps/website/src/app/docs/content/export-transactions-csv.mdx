section: export
order: 1

Midday tracks each transaction through a clear lifecycle so you always know what needs attention and what's been exported.

## Transaction statuses

Every transaction has a status that tells you where it is in the flow:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **No receipt** | Default state. No receipt attached yet. |
| **Receipt found** | Midday found a possible receipt match. Confirm or dismiss it. |
| **Ready to export** | Receipt attached. This transaction is in the export queue. |
| **Exporting** | Export is in progress. |
| **Exported** | Successfully exported. Final state. |
| **Export failed** | Something went wrong. Needs attention before retry. |
| **Excluded** | Excluded from analytics and the export queue. |
| **Archived** | No longer part of active workflows. |

## The export flow

Transactions move through this lifecycle:

1. A transaction arrives from your bank connection (status: **No receipt**)
2. Midday finds a matching receipt automatically (status: **Receipt found**)
3. You confirm the match — or attach a receipt manually (status: **Ready to export**)
4. You export from the Review tab (status: **Exporting** → **Exported**)

If an export fails, the transaction moves to **Export failed** and stays in the Review tab so you can fix the issue and retry.

## Tabs

### All

Shows every transaction across all statuses. Use filters to narrow by status, date, category, account, and more. Excluded and Archived transactions are hidden by default but available via the status filter.

### Review

The export queue. Shows only transactions that are **Ready to export** or have an **Export failed** status. No filters apply here — it always shows the full queue so it can reliably reach zero.

When the Review tab is empty, you're done.

## Exporting

### To accounting software (Xero, QuickBooks, Fortnox)

If you've connected an accounting provider:

1. Go to the **Review** tab
2. Select transactions (or export all)
3. Click **Export** and choose your provider
4. Transactions and receipts are sent to your accounting software

[Connect Xero →](/docs/connect-xero) · [Connect QuickBooks →](/docs/connect-quickbooks) · [Connect Fortnox →](/docs/connect-fortnox)

### To CSV

If you export to a file instead:

1. Go to the **Review** tab (or use filters in **All**)
2. Select transactions
3. Click **Export** → **CSV**
4. Download the file

The CSV includes date, description, amount, category, account, tags, receipt links, and notes.

## Actions

You can manage transactions with these actions:

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mark ready** | Moves a transaction to the export queue (Review tab) |
| **Unmark ready** | Removes from the export queue |
| **Mark exported** | Manually marks as exported (use only if exported outside Midday) |
| **Unmark exported** | Moves an exported transaction back to the Review tab |
| **Exclude** | Removes from analytics and the export queue (bulk action) |
| **Include** | Reverses an exclusion |
| **Archive** | Hides from active workflows (bulk action) |

## Tips

- Export regularly (weekly or monthly) to keep your accounting software current
- Attach receipts before exporting — they export with the transaction
- Use the Review tab as your to-do list: when it's empty, you're caught up
- If your accountant needs a file, use CSV export. If they use Xero, QuickBooks, or Fortnox, use the direct integration instead
