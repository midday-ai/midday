The Midday assistant lets you ask questions about your finances in plain language and get instant answers.

2. The assistant is available from the home screen
3. Type your question
4. Get an instant response

## What you can ask

The assistant understands questions about your financial data:

### Revenue and income
- "What was my revenue last month?"
- "Show me revenue by customer this quarter"
- "How does this month compare to last month?"

### Expenses and spending
- "What did I spend on software last quarter?"
- "Show my top expenses this year"
- "How much have I spent with Amazon?"

### Cash and runway
- "What's my current balance?"
- "How long will my cash last?"
- "What's my monthly burn rate?"

### Invoices
- "Do I have any overdue invoices?"
- "Who owes me money?"
- "Show unpaid invoices for Acme Corp"

### Time tracking
- "How many hours did I track this week?"
- "Show time by project this month"
- "What's unbilled for Client X?"

## How it works

The assistant:

1. Understands your question using AI
2. Queries your actual Midday data
3. Returns accurate, real-time answers

It's not making up numbers—it's reading from your transactions, invoices, and tracked time.

## Tips

- Be specific: "Revenue last month" is better than "How am I doing?"
- Include time periods: "this month," "last quarter," "in 2024"
- Ask follow-ups: The assistant remembers context in a conversation

## Limitations

The assistant can answer questions about data in Midday. It cannot:

- Make predictions or forecasts
- Access external data
- Make changes to your account (it's read-only)
- Answer questions about features not yet available

## Privacy

Your conversations with the assistant are private. We don't use your financial data to train AI models.
