Keep track of your invoices from sent to paid. Know exactly who owes you money and when to follow up.

## Invoice statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Created but not sent |
| Sent | Delivered to customer |
| Viewed | Customer opened the invoice |
| Paid | Payment received |
| Overdue | Past due date, unpaid |

## View invoice status

1. Go to [Invoices](https://app.midday.ai/invoices)
2. See status badges on each invoice
3. Filter by status to focus on specific invoices

### Filter by status

Click status filters to see:

- **Unpaid**: All outstanding invoices
- **Overdue**: Need immediate attention
- **Paid**: Completed invoices

## Mark as paid

When you receive payment outside of Stripe:

1. Open the invoice
2. Click **Mark as paid**
3. Optionally add payment date and method

This updates your records without requiring online payment.

## Send reminders

For overdue invoices:

1. Open the overdue invoice
2. Click **Send reminder**
3. A reminder email is sent to your customer

Be professional but persistent. A friendly reminder often does the trick.

## Best practices

### Before due date
- Send invoices promptly
- Set reasonable due dates (Net 14 or Net 30 are common)
- Enable online payments for faster collection

### When overdue
- Send a reminder within a few days
- Follow up by phone or email for large amounts
- Consider payment plans for long-standing invoices

### General tips
- Review unpaid invoices weekly
- Note customers with slow payment history
- Update payment terms if needed
