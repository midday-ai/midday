The Vault is your centralized document storage in Midday. Store contracts, receipts, statements, and any business documents—all searchable and organized.

## What is the Vault

The Vault is a secure file storage system built into Midday. Unlike your inbox (which captures receipts for transaction matching), the Vault is for any document you want to keep:

- Contracts and agreements
- Tax documents
- Business licenses and permits
- Bank statements
- Legal documents
- Team documents
- Any file you need to access later

## Access the Vault

1. Go to [Vault](https://app.midday.ai/vault)
2. You'll see all your stored documents
3. Use search and filters to find what you need

## Upload documents

### Drag and drop

1. Open the Vault
2. Drag files directly into the window
3. Files upload automatically

### Click to upload

1. Click the **Upload** button
2. Select files from your computer
3. Files upload automatically

### Supported file types

The Vault accepts common business document formats:

- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- **Spreadsheets**: XLS, XLSX, CSV
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, HEIC
- **Other**: Most common file formats

## Organize with tags

Tags help you categorize and find documents later.

### Add tags

1. Click on a document
2. Click **Add tag** or the tag icon
3. Select existing tags or create new ones
4. Save

### Create a tagging system

Consistent tags make documents easier to find:

- **By type**: `contract`, `receipt`, `tax`, `legal`
- **By year**: `2024`, `2025`
- **By client**: `acme-corp`, `client-b`
- **By status**: `signed`, `draft`, `expired`

### Filter by tags

1. Use the filter panel
2. Select one or more tags
3. View matching documents

## Search documents

The Vault search looks through:

- File names
- Tags
- Document metadata

Type in the search box to find documents instantly.

## Connect documents to transactions

Link Vault documents to specific transactions for a complete audit trail:

1. Open the document in the Vault
2. Click **Link to transaction**
3. Search for and select the transaction
4. The document is now attached

This is useful for:
- Attaching contracts to related payments
- Linking statements to reconciliation
- Connecting any supporting document to a transaction

## Vault vs. Inbox

| Feature | Vault | Inbox |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Purpose | Long-term document storage | Receipt capture and matching |
| Matching | Manual linking to transactions | Automatic AI matching |
| Organization | Tags and folders | Status-based (pending, matched) |
| Use case | Contracts, statements, any documents | Receipts, invoices for bookkeeping |

Use both:
- **Inbox** for receipts that need to match transactions
- **Vault** for documents you want to keep and organize

## Download documents

1. Click on any document
2. Click **Download**
3. The file downloads to your computer

You can also download multiple files by selecting them and using bulk actions.

## Delete documents

1. Click on the document
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

Deleted documents are removed permanently. Make sure you have backups of important files before deleting.

## Storage and limits

Your storage limit depends on your plan. Check your current usage in [Settings → Billing](https://app.midday.ai/settings/billing).

If you're approaching your limit:
- Delete documents you no longer need
- Compress large files before uploading
- Upgrade your plan for more storage

## Security

Your documents are stored securely:

- **Encryption**: Files are encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access control**: Only your team members can access your Vault
- **No public access**: Documents are never publicly accessible

## Tips

- **Upload regularly**: Don't let documents pile up—upload as you receive them
- **Tag consistently**: A good tagging system saves time later
- **Use descriptive names**: Rename files before uploading for easier search
- **Back up critical documents**: The Vault is secure, but keep copies of irreplaceable documents

## Coming from another tool

If you're migrating from Dropbox, Google Drive, or another storage system:

1. Download your business documents
2. Organize them by type or date
3. Upload to the Vault in batches
4. Add tags as you upload
