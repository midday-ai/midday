## Countries with separate systems (planned)

Some countries have their own mandatory e-invoicing systems that require country-specific integrations beyond Peppol:

- **Spain** — VERI\*FACTU system, mandatory from January 2027
- **Italy** — SDI (Sistema di Interscambio) for domestic B2B
- **Portugal** — AT (Autoridade Tributaria) certified invoicing
- **Mexico** — CFDI via SAT
- **Colombia** — DIAN electronic invoicing
- **Greece** — myDATA reporting via IAPR
- **Brazil** — NF-e / NFS-e electronic documents
- **Poland** — KSeF 2.0

These are on our roadmap. Even for these countries, Peppol can be used for cross-border invoicing with other Peppol participants.
