Scopes define what data and actions your OAuth application can access. Request only the scopes your app needs—users are more likely to authorize apps with limited, focused permissions.

## How scopes work

- Scopes are requested during the authorization flow
- Users see the requested permissions before authorizing
- Your app can only access data allowed by granted scopes
- Scopes cannot be upgraded without re-authorization

## Scope format

Scopes follow the pattern `resource.permission`:

- `transactions.read` — Read transaction data
- `invoices.write` — Create, update, delete invoices

## Available scopes

### Transactions

| Scope | Description |

### Invoices

| `notifications.read` | View notifications |
| `notifications.write` | Mark notifications as read, manage settings |

**Use cases**: Notification aggregators, alert systems

## Meta scopes

For apps that need broad access, meta scopes provide convenient shortcuts:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `apis.read` | Read-only access to all resources |
| `apis.all` | Full read and write access to all resources |

Use meta scopes sparingly. Most apps should request specific scopes.

## Requesting scopes

Include scopes in the authorization URL as a space-separated list:

```
https://app.midday.ai/oauth/authorize?
  response_type=code&
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
  scope=transactions.read%20invoices.read%20customers.read&
  state=STATE
```

URL-encode the scope parameter (spaces become `%20`).

## Scope validation

When users authorize your app:

1. Midday validates requested scopes against your app's registered scopes
2. Invalid or unregistered scopes cause authorization to fail
3. Users see exactly what permissions they're granting

If you need additional scopes later, users must re-authorize your app.

## Scope combinations

### Financial dashboard

```
transactions.read invoices.read bank-accounts.read reports.read
```

### Invoice automation

```
invoices.read invoices.write customers.read customers.write
```

### Time tracking integration

```
tracker-projects.read tracker-projects.write tracker-entries.read tracker-entries.write
```

### Accounting export

```
transactions.read invoices.read customers.read documents.read
```

### Full read-only access

```
apis.read
```

## Best practices

### Request minimal scopes

Only request what you need. Users trust apps that ask for limited permissions.

**Good**: `transactions.read` for a spending tracker

**Avoid**: `apis.all` when you only need to read transactions

### Separate read and write

If your app only displays data, don't request write scopes:

```
transactions.read invoices.read
```

### Group related scopes

If you need invoices, you likely need customers too:

```
invoices.read invoices.write customers.read
```

### Document your requirements

Tell users why you need each scope in your app's description or onboarding flow.

## Checking granted scopes

The token response includes the granted scopes:

```json
{
  "access_token": "mid_at_xxxxx",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "mid_rt_xxxxx",
  "scope": "transactions.read invoices.read"
}
```

Check this against your requested scopes to confirm what was granted.
