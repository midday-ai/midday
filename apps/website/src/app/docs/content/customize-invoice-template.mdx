Customize your invoice template to reflect your brand and save time on each invoice.

## Access template settings

Template settings are available directly in the invoice editor. Click the **gear icon** in the bottom toolbar to open the settings menu, organized into categories:

- **Invoice** — Size, currency, date format, payment terms
- **Tax & Pricing** — Tax, VAT, discounts, decimals, units, QR code
- **Email** — PDF attachment, send copy
- **Payments** — Stripe online payments

You can also manage templates (rename, duplicate, set as default, delete) from the same menu.

## Branding

### Logo

Upload your company logo:

- Appears at the top of every invoice
- Recommended size: 400x200 pixels
- PNG or JPG format

### Colors

Customize accent colors to match your brand.

## Business details

Set your default business information:

- **Company name**: Your legal business name
- **Address**: Your business address
- **Email**: Contact email shown on invoices
- **Phone**: Optional contact phone
- **Website**: Optional website URL

These appear on every invoice automatically.

## Tax settings

### Tax identification

- **VAT number**: Your VAT/GST number
- **Tax ID**: Other tax identification numbers

These appear on invoices for compliance.

### Default tax rate

Set a default tax rate:

- Applied to new invoices automatically
- Can be overridden per invoice
- Set to 0% if you don't charge tax

## Payment details

### Bank details

Add your bank information for wire transfers:

- Bank name
- Account number / IBAN
- Routing number / SWIFT

### Payment terms

Set default payment terms:

- **Due date**: Net 14, Net 30, etc.
- **Late fees**: Optional late payment terms
- **Notes**: Standard payment instructions

## Invoice numbering

Configure invoice number format:

- **Prefix**: Optional prefix (e.g., "INV-")
- **Starting number**: Where to begin numbering
- **Format**: Number of digits

Example: INV-00001, INV-00002, etc.

## Default notes

Add standard text that appears on all invoices:

- Payment instructions
- Thank you message
- Terms and conditions
- Return policy

## Email template

Each template stores its own email content. When you send an invoice via **Create & Send**, the customer receives an email based on these settings.

### Customize the email

Click the email preview button in the invoice editor toolbar (visible when **Create & Send** is selected) to open a live preview. You can edit:

- **Subject line** — The email subject your customer sees in their inbox (defaults to "[Company Name] sent you an invoice")
- **Heading** — The title inside the email body (defaults to "Invoice from [Company Name]")
- **Body text** — The message below the invoice details
- **Button label** — The call-to-action button text (defaults to "View invoice")

The subject line and heading are independent — customizing one does not affect the other. Click directly on any text in the preview to edit it. Changes save automatically to the current template.

### What the email shows

The email automatically includes data from the invoice:

- Your template logo
- Invoice amount and currency
- Due date (using your template's date format and label)
- Invoice number (using your template's label)
- A sign-off with your company name

These values update automatically based on each invoice — you don't need to edit them manually.

### Email options

In the **Email** settings category:

- **Attach PDF** — Include the invoice as a PDF attachment
- **Send copy (BCC)** — Send yourself a copy of every invoice email

## Tips

- Set up your template before creating your first invoice
- Use a professional logo—it makes a big difference
- Include clear payment instructions to get paid faster
- Customize your email template once — it applies to all invoices using that template
- Review and update annually or when business details change
