Tags let you add custom labels to transactions beyond the standard categories. Use them to track projects, clients, tax categories, or anything else.

## What tags are for

Tags are flexible labels you define:

- **Projects**: Tag expenses by project for cost tracking
- **Clients**: Tag transactions related to specific clients
- **Tax categories**: Tag deductible expenses
- **Departments**: Track spending by department or team

Unlike categories (which are predefined), tags are completely customizable.

## Add tags to transactions

1. Go to [Transactions](https://app.midday.ai/transactions)
2. Click on a transaction
3. Click **Add tag** or the tag icon
4. Select existing tag or create new one
5. Save

A transaction can have multiple tags.

## Create tags

Tags are created as you use them:

1. Click **Add tag** on any transaction
2. Type a new tag name
3. Press Enter to create it

Or manage all tags from settings.

## Filter by tags

Find transactions with specific tags:

1. Open the filter panel
2. Select **Tags**
3. Choose one or more tags
4. View filtered results

## Tag reports

Use tags to generate custom reports:

- Export transactions filtered by tag
- See spending by tag
- Track project profitability

## Tips

- Use consistent naming: "Client: Acme" not "Acme client"
- Keep tags focused—too many becomes unwieldy
- Review and clean up unused tags periodically
- Tags are great for things categories don't cover
