Customize your invoices to match your brand and include all the details your customers need. These settings apply to all invoices you create.

## Access invoice settings

Invoice settings are available directly in the invoice editor. Click the **gear icon** in the bottom toolbar to open the settings menu. Settings are organized into four categories:

- **Invoice** — Size, currency, date format, payment terms
- **Tax & Pricing** — Sales tax, VAT, line item tax, discount, decimals, units, QR code
- **Email** — PDF attachment, send copy (BCC)
- **Payments** — Accept online payments via Stripe

Each category opens a sub-menu with the relevant options. Changes are saved automatically to your current template.

## Branding

### Logo

Add your company logo to appear on all invoices:

1. Click **Upload logo**
2. Select an image file (PNG, JPG, or SVG recommended)
3. Your logo appears in the header of all invoices

**Tips for logos**:
- Use a high-resolution image (at least 200px wide)
- Transparent PNG works best
- Square or horizontal logos display well

### Company details

Your business information appears on every invoice:

- **Company name**: Your legal business name
- **Address**: Your business address
- **Email**: Contact email for invoice queries
- **Phone**: Optional contact number
- **Website**: Optional company website
- **VAT/Tax ID**: Your tax identification number

Set these in [Settings](https://app.midday.ai/settings) under company information.

## Invoice numbering

### Automatic numbering

Midday auto-generates invoice numbers sequentially:

- Format: INV-0001, INV-0002, etc.
- Increments automatically with each invoice
- Ensures no duplicate numbers

### Custom prefix

Customize the invoice number prefix:

1. Go to invoice settings
2. Change the prefix (e.g., "MID-" instead of "INV-")
3. All new invoices use this prefix

### Manual override

You can change individual invoice numbers when creating:

1. Create or edit an invoice
2. Click on the invoice number
3. Enter your custom number
4. Ensure it's unique

## Payment details

### Bank transfer details

Add your bank account information for wire/transfer payments:

- **Bank name**: Your bank's name
- **Account number**: Your account number
- **Routing number**: Bank routing/sort code
- **IBAN**: For international transfers
- **SWIFT/BIC**: For international transfers

These details appear on the invoice so customers know where to send payment.

### Multiple payment methods

You can include:

- Bank transfer details
- Online payment via Stripe (if connected)
- Other payment instructions in the notes

## Online payments (Stripe)

Connect Stripe to let customers pay invoices online with a credit card.

### Connect Stripe

1. Go to invoice settings
2. Click **Connect Stripe**
3. Sign in to your Stripe account (or create one)
4. Complete the connection

### How it works

Once connected:

- All invoices include a **Pay** button
- Customers pay via Stripe's secure checkout
- The invoice automatically marks as paid
- Funds deposit to your bank account (minus Stripe fees)

### Fees

Stripe charges standard processing fees (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction). Midday doesn't charge additional payment fees.

## Default settings

### Payment terms

Set the default due date for new invoices:

- **Due on receipt**: Payment expected immediately
- **Net 7**: Due 7 days from invoice date
- **Net 15**: Due 15 days from invoice date
- **Net 30**: Due 30 days from invoice date (most common)
- **Net 60**: Due 60 days from invoice date
- **Custom**: Set your own number of days

You can change this per invoice when needed.

### Currency

Set your default invoice currency:

- New invoices use this currency by default
- You can change currency per invoice
- Multiple currencies are supported

### Tax/VAT

Configure default tax settings:

- **Tax rate**: Default percentage to apply
- **Tax name**: What to call it (VAT, GST, Sales Tax, etc.)
- **Tax ID display**: Show your tax ID on invoices

These can be overridden per invoice or per line item.

## Invoice templates

### Built-in templates

Midday includes professional templates that work for most businesses. Your branding (logo, colors, details) applies automatically.

### Template customization

Customize how your invoices look:

- **Color scheme**: Match your brand colors
- **Layout preferences**: Adjust what information displays where
- **Footer content**: Custom text at the bottom

## Notes and terms

### Default notes

Add text that appears on every invoice:

- Thank you messages
- Payment instructions
- Terms and conditions
- Late payment policies

Example:
> Thank you for your business. Payment is due within 30 days. Late payments may incur a 1.5% monthly fee.

### Per-invoice notes

You can add or edit notes on individual invoices for customer-specific messages.

## Products/Services catalog

Save commonly used line items:

1. Go to [Invoices → Products](https://app.midday.ai/invoices/products)
2. Add products or services you invoice frequently
3. Include name, description, and default price
4. Select from the catalog when creating invoices

This saves time if you invoice the same items repeatedly.

## Email settings

### What the email includes

When you send an invoice via **Create & Send**, the customer receives an email with:

- Your invoice template logo (or the Midday logo if none is set)
- A heading (customizable, defaults to "Invoice from [Company Name]")
- The invoice amount, due date, and invoice number
- A **View invoice** button linking to the online invoice
- A body message with your sign-off
- A PDF attachment (if enabled in settings)
- A **Pay** button (if Stripe is connected)

All labels (like "Due Date" and "Invoice No") match the labels configured in your invoice template.

### Preview and customize the email

When **Create & Send** is selected as your delivery method, an email preview button appears in the invoice editor toolbar. Click it to open a preview of the exact email your customer will receive.

From the preview, you can click on any text to edit it directly:

- **Subject line** — The email subject your customer sees in their inbox (defaults to "[Company Name] sent you an invoice")
- **Heading** — The title inside the email body (defaults to "Invoice from [Company Name]")
- **Body text** — Customize the message below the invoice details
- **Button label** — Change the call-to-action text (defaults to "View invoice")

The subject line and heading are independent — customizing one does not affect the other.

Changes save automatically to your current template, so they apply to all future invoices using that template.

### PDF attachment

Toggle **Attach PDF** in the **Email** settings category to include or exclude the invoice PDF as an email attachment. When enabled, the email preview shows the attached filename.

### Send copy (BCC)

Toggle **Send copy (BCC)** to receive a copy of every invoice email sent to customers. The copy is sent to your account email address.

## Reminders

### Automatic reminders

Set up reminders for unpaid invoices:

- Before due date (e.g., 3 days before)
- On due date
- After due date (e.g., 7 days overdue)

Configure in invoice settings.

### Manual reminders

Send reminders manually from any unpaid invoice:

1. Open the invoice
2. Click **Send reminder**
3. Customer receives a reminder email

## Best practices

1. **Complete your profile first**: Set up branding and payment details before sending invoices
2. **Use consistent numbering**: Don't skip numbers or use duplicates
3. **Include payment details**: Make it easy for customers to pay
4. **Enable online payments**: Customers pay faster when it's easy
5. **Set appropriate terms**: Net 30 is standard; adjust for your industry
6. **Add clear notes**: Include any terms or late payment policies

## Troubleshooting

### Logo not displaying

- Check file format (PNG, JPG, SVG)
- Ensure file size isn't too large
- Try re-uploading

### Invoice numbering reset

- Invoice numbers are unique and don't reset
- Contact support if you need to adjust the sequence

### Payment details not showing

- Verify bank details are entered in settings
- Check that the invoice isn't set to online-only payment
