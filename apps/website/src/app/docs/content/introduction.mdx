Midday is your business's financial operating system. It brings together banking, invoicing, time tracking, and bookkeeping preparation in one place—so you can spend less time on admin and more time building your business.

## Who is Midday for?

Midday is built for:

- **Solo founders** running a business and wanting real-time financial visibility
- **SMB owners** who need to understand cash flow, runway, and profitability
- **Startups** scaling their operations and preparing for growth or fundraising
- **Small teams** managing multiple clients, projects, and team members

If you're tired of juggling spreadsheets, multiple apps, and manual data entry, Midday brings everything together.

## What makes Midday different

### Automation-first

Transactions sync automatically. Receipts match to transactions automatically. Categories are assigned automatically. You review and refine—not do manual data entry.

### Built for founders

Financial metrics that matter: runway, burn rate, profit margins. Not just transaction lists, but insights into your business health.

### AI-powered

From categorizing transactions to matching receipts to answering questions about your finances, AI handles the tedious work.

### Accountant-ready

When it's time for taxes or year-end, export clean, categorized data to your accountant or directly to accounting software.
