This guide walks you through setting up Midday in about 5 minutes. By the end, you'll have your bank connected and be ready to track your finances.

## Step 1: Create your account

1. Go to [app.midday.ai](https://app.midday.ai)
2. Sign up with your email or Google account
3. Enter your business name and select your base currency

Your base currency is used for financial reports. You can still handle transactions in multiple currencies.

## Step 2: Connect your bank

This is the most important step. Once connected, your transactions flow in automatically.

1. Go to [Settings → Accounts](https://app.midday.ai/settings/accounts)
2. Click **Connect bank**
3. Search for your bank (we support 20,000+ banks worldwide)
4. Complete the secure authentication

Transactions typically sync within a few minutes. Historical transactions (usually 90 days) are pulled automatically.

## Step 3: Review your transactions

Go to [Transactions](https://app.midday.ai/transactions) to see everything that's synced:

- Transactions are automatically categorized by AI
- Click any transaction to add notes, tags, or change the category
- Use filters to find specific transactions

Tip: Spend a few minutes checking the AI categories. The more you correct, the smarter it gets for your business.

## Step 4: Set up your inbox (optional but recommended)

The inbox captures receipts and matches them to transactions automatically.

**Option A: Email forwarding**
Forward receipts to your unique inbox email address. Find it in [Inbox → Settings](https://app.midday.ai/inbox/settings).

**Option B: Connect email**
Connect Gmail or Outlook to automatically capture receipts from your existing email.

2. Click **Create invoice**
3. Add your customer and line items
4. Choose **Send** to email it, or **Save as draft** to finish later
