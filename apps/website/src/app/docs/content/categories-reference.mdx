Midday uses a structured category system to organize your transactions. Understanding these categories helps you maintain accurate books and ensures your financial metrics are calculated correctly.

## How categories work

Every transaction in Midday is assigned to a category. The AI automatically categorizes transactions when they sync, and you can adjust categories at any time. Categories are organized in a two-level hierarchy: parent categories contain more specific subcategories.

Categories affect your financial reports:

- **Revenue categories** count toward your income
- **Expense categories** count toward your burn rate and reduce profit
- **Excluded categories** are intentionally left out of burn rate calculations to prevent double-counting

## Excluded categories

Two categories are marked as "excluded" and won't count toward your burn rate:

- **Credit Card Payment**: When you pay your credit card bill from your checking account, this transaction is excluded. Why? Because the individual purchases on your credit card already count as expenses. Counting the payment would double-count those expenses.

- **Internal Transfer**: Moving money between your own accounts isn't an expense—it's just reorganizing your cash. These transfers are excluded from burn rate.

This exclusion logic is automatic. You don't need to do anything special.
