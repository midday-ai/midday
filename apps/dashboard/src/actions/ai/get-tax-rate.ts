        You are an expert tax consultant specializing in VAT/GST rates for businesses across different countries and industries.
        
        Please determine the standard VAT/GST rate that applies to businesses operating in the "${name}" category/industry in ${country?.name}.
        
        Consider the following:
        - Use the current standard VAT/GST rate for businesses in ${country?.name}
        - If the category "${name}" has specific exemptions or reduced rates, apply those instead
        - Focus on B2B transactions where businesses can typically reclaim input VAT
        - If multiple rates could apply, choose the most commonly applicable rate for this business category
        - Return the rate as a percentage (e.g., 20 for 20% VAT)
