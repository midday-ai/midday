Our most requested feature is now ready for you to try! Introducing Solomon AI Assistant. With help from the community, we have implemented many great features. Here are some highlights of what you can do using the assistant today:

<br />

- Find the things you are looking for (transactions, invoices, documents, and more)
- Watch your spending
- View your profit, revenue, burn rate, and revenue graphs
- Find transactions without receipts

<br />
These are just some examples. You can ask follow-up questions and dig deeper
into your data.

<br />

This is just the beginning of Solomon AI Assistant, and we will continue to invest and listen to your feedback so you have everything you need to run your business. Don't hesitate to give us feedback directly from the assistant or by scheduling a quick [15-minute call](https://cal.com/pontus-Solomon AI/15min) with us to share your thoughts!

<br />
If you are running Solomon AI on Mac, you should update to `v1.9` for the latest
version.
