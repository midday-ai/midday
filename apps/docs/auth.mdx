## Introduction

Midday supports multiple authentication methods through Supabase Auth. This guide will walk you through setting up different authentication providers for your local development or self-hosted installation.

## Email Authentication

Midday uses passwordless email authentication as the primary method. Users receive a magic link or OTP code to sign in.

### Configuration

Go to Email Templates in the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

Modify the template to include the `{{ .Token }}` variable, for example:

```html
<h2>One time login code</h2>
<p>Please enter this code: {{ .Token }}</p>
```

For detailed configuration steps, refer to the [Supabase Email OTP documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-passwordless#enabling-email-otp).
