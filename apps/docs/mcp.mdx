# MCP Server

Midday exposes a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants like Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor to interact with your financial data.

## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.midday.ai/mcp
```

## Authentication

The MCP endpoint requires authentication using your Midday API key. Include it in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer mid_your_api_key
```

### Getting an API Key

1. Go to **Settings → Developer** in the Midday dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Choose the appropriate scope (Full Access, Read Only, or Restricted)
4. Copy and securely store the generated key

### Using Prompts

Prompts can be invoked through the MCP client:

```typescript
// Get a prompt template
const prompt = await client.getPrompt({
  name: "financial_health_check",
  arguments: {
    period: "quarter"
  }
});

// The AI will receive instructions to perform the analysis
console.log(prompt.messages);
```

## Tool Annotations

All tools include MCP annotations to help AI assistants make better decisions:

- `readOnlyHint: true` - All tools are read-only and safe to call
- `destructiveHint: false` - No tools modify or delete data
- `idempotentHint: true` - Tools can be called multiple times safely

## Client Configuration

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "midday": {
      "url": "https://api.midday.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mid_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (requires [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote)):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "midday": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://api.midday.ai/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer mid_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenAI / Custom Clients

Use the MCP SDK to connect:

```typescript
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";

const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport({
  url: "https://api.midday.ai/mcp",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer mid_your_api_key",
  },
});

const client = new Client({
  name: "my-client",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

await client.connect(transport);

// List available tools
const tools = await client.listTools();
console.log(tools);

// Call a tool
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "transactions_list",
  arguments: {
    pageSize: 10,
    type: "expense",
  },
});
console.log(result);

await client.close();
```

## Example Usage

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant questions like:

- "Show me my recent transactions"
- "What invoices are overdue?"
- "List all customers"
- "How much time did I track last week?"
- "What's my bank account balance?"
- "What's my burn rate this quarter?"
- "How many months of runway do I have?"
- "Search for transactions from Acme Corp"
- "What's my profit this year compared to last year?"
- "Show me my spending by category"

The AI will use the appropriate MCP tools to fetch the data and provide answers.

## Security Considerations

- API keys have the same permissions as the scopes you select when creating them
- Use **Read Only** or **Restricted** scopes for AI assistants when possible
- Rotate keys regularly
- Never share API keys in public repositories or chat logs
